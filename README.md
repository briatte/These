==================


This is my PhD manuscript in French.  
To compile the whole manuscript:  
```
./compileThis.sh all.tex
```  

To compile a specific chapter:  

```
./compileThis.sh CHAPTERFOLDER/main.tex
```

Good luck with the reading.

### Dependencies

I rely on [latexmk][1].  
This is normally installed if you have texlive.
