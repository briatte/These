==================


This is my PhD manuscript in French.  
To compile the whole manuscript:  
```
./compileThis.sh
```  

To compile specific chapters:  

```
./compileThis.sh CHAPTERFOLDER1 CHAPTERFOLDER2
```

Good luck with the reading.

### Dependencies

I rely on [latexmk][1].  
This is normally installed if you have texlive.
