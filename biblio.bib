abstract = {Discovery of communities in complex networks is a fundamental data analysis problem with applications in various domains. Most of the existing approaches have focused on discovering communities of nodes, while recent studies have shown great advantages and utilities of the knowledge of communities of links in networks. From this new perspective, we propose a link dynamics based algorithm, called UELC, for identifying link communities of networks. In UELC, the stochastic process of a link–node–link random walk is employed to unfold an embedded bipartition structure of links in a network. The local mixing properties of the Markov chain underlying the random walk are then utilized to extract two emerging link communities. Further, the random walk and the bipartitioning processes are wrapped in an iterative subdivision strategy to recursively identify link partitions that segregate the network links into multiple subdivisions. We evaluate the performance of the new method on synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate its utility on real-world networks. Our experimental results show that our method is highly effective for discovering link communities in complex networks. As a comparison, we also extend UELC to extracting communities of nodes, and show that it is effective for node community identification.},

abstract = {Inhomogeneous temporal processes, like those appearing in human communications, neuron spike trains, and seismic signals, consist of high-activity bursty intervals alternating with long low-activity periods. In recent studies such bursty behavior has been characterized by a fat-tailed inter-event time distribution, while temporal correlations were measured by the autocorrelation function. However, these characteristic functions are not capable to fully characterize temporally correlated heterogenous behavior. Here we show that the distribution of the number of events in a bursty period serves as a good indicator of the dependencies, leading to the universal observation of power-law distribution for a broad class of phenomena. We find that the correlations in these quite different systems can be commonly interpreted by memory effects and described by a simple phenomenological model, which displays temporal behavior qualitatively similar to that in real systems.},

abstract = {Community structure can naturally emerge in paths to synchronization, and scratching it from the paths is a tough issue that accounts for the diverse dynamics of synchronization. In this paper, with assumption that the synchronization on complex networks is made up of local and collective processes, we proposed a scheme to lock the local synchronization (phase locking) at a stable state meanwhile suppress the collective synchronization based on Kuramoto model. Through this scheme, the network dynamics only contains the local synchronization, which suggests that the nodes in the same community synchronize together and these synchronization clusters well reveal the community structure of network. Furthermore, by analyzing the paths to synchronization, the relations or overlaps among different communities are also obtained. Thus, the community detection based on the scheme is performed on five real networks and the observed community structures are much more apparent than modularity-based fast algorithm. Our results not only provide a deep insight to understand the synchronization dynamics on complex network but also enlarge the research scope of community detection.},

abstract = {We propose a new multiplex-based strategy to integrate different layers of genomic information and use them in a coordinate way to identify driving cancer genes. The multiplex networks that we consider combine transcription factor co-targeting, microRNA co-targeting, protein-protein interaction and gene co-expression networks. The rationale behind this choice is that gene coexpression and protein-protein interactions require a tight coregulation of the partners and that such a fine tuned regulation can be obtained only combining both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional layers of regulation. . To extract the relevant biological information from the multiplex we studied its partition into communities. To this end we applied a consensus clustering algorithm to the single-layer partitions obtained using state of art community detection methods, combined with a filtering preprocessing of the individual networks. Even if our procedure is valid in principle for any pathology in this work we concentrate in particular on the gastric, lung, pancreas and colorectal cancer and identified from the enrichment analysis of the multiplex communities a set of candidate driver cancer genes. Some of them were already known oncogenes while a few are new and represent the major result of our analysis. The combination of the different layers of information allowed us to extract from the multiplex indications on the regulatory pattern and the functional role of both the already known oncogenes and the new candidate driver genes.},

For example, self-reports of physical proximity deviate from mobile phone records depending on the recency and salience of the interactions. We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 95{\%} of friendships based on the observational data alone, where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns in their physical proximity and calling patterns. These behavioral patterns, in turn, allow the prediction of individual-level outcomes such as job satisfaction.},

abstract = {Most methods proposed to uncover communities in complex networks rely on their structural properties. Here we introduce the stability of a network partition, a measure of its quality defined in terms of the statistical properties of a dynamical process taking place on the graph. The time-scale of the process acts as an intrinsic parameter that uncovers community structures at different resolutions. The stability extends and unifies standard notions for community detection: modularity and spectral partitioning can be seen as limiting cases of our dynamic measure. Similarly, recently proposed multi-resolution methods correspond to linearisations of the stability at short times. The connection between community detection and Laplacian dynamics enables us to establish dynamically motivated stability measures linked to distinct null models. We apply our method to find multi-scale partitions for different networks and show that the stability can be computed efficiently for large networks with extended versions of current algorithms.},

While in its technical infancy, mobile network community analysis is an important capability in network planning, management, and adaptation strategies. We first present some discussion and technical background required to describe the analytical components and dynamic network modeling techniques. A set of mobile network scenarios are then described and applied to demonstrate the use of the dynamic spectral partitioning methods. We also develop and present a potential aid to dynamically establish partition set size and introduce a heuristic metric for partitioning quality. Our dynamic network experiments are represented by a series of evolving weighted graphs with dynamic attribute data that we plan to use in future work to represent network neighbor quality effects or other metrics as deemed appropriate to the scenario. We conclude by reviewing results and discussing future work.},

abstract = {Temporal networks come with a wide variety of heterogeneities, from burstiness of event sequences to correlations between timingsof node and link activations. In this paper, we set to explore the latter by using greedy walks as probes of temporal network structure. Given a temporal network (a sequence of contacts), greedy walks proceed from node to node by always following the first available contact. Because of this, their structure is particularly sensitive to temporal-topological patterns involving repeated contacts between sets of nodes. This becomes evident in their small coverage per step as compared to a temporal reference model -- in empirical temporal networks, greedy walks often get stuck within small sets of nodes because of correlated contact patterns. While this may also happen in static networks that have pronounced community structure, the use of the temporal reference model takes the underlying static network structure out of the equation and indicates that there is a purely temporal reason for the observations. Further analysis of the structure of greedy walks indicates that burst trains, sequences of repeated contacts between node pairs, are the dominant factor. However, there are larger patterns too, as shown with non-backtracking greedy walks. We proceed further to study the entropy rates of greedy walks, and show that the sequences of visited nodes are more structured and predictable in original data as compared to temporally uncorrelated references. Taken together, these results indicate a richness of correlated temporal-topological patterns in temporal networks.},

The time complexity for finding a local community of all these algorithms is O(Kd), where K is the number of vertices to be explored in the sub-graph and d is the average degree of the vertices in the sub-graph. A JAVA tool is developed based on these algorithms to identify local community structures in large networks. The results of using this tool to analyze a co-purchase network from Amazon.com show that local community structures exist in this large-scale co-purchase network. Further analyses of the identified local communities show that purchases of media items form more compact local communities than purchases of book items do, indicating that recommending digital media items to customers based on co-purchasing information in the online store is more efficient than recommending books.

@article{Dreier2014,
abstract = {Complex networks can be typically broken down into groups or modules. Discovering this "community structure" is an important step in studying the large-scale structure of networks. Many algorithms have been proposed for community detection and benchmarks have been created to evaluate their performance. Typically algorithms for community detection either partition the graph (non-overlapping communities) or find node covers (overlapping communities).   In this paper, we propose a particularly simple semi-supervised learning algorithm for finding out communities. In essence, given the community information of a small number of "seed nodes", the method uses random walks from the seed nodes to uncover the community information of the whole network. The algorithm runs in time {\$}O(k \backslashcdot m \backslashcdot \backslashlog n){\$}, where {\$}m{\$} is the number of edges; {\$}n{\$} the number of links; and {\$}k{\$} the number of communities in the network. In sparse networks with {\$}m = O(n){\$} and a constant number of communities, this running time is almost linear in the size of the network. Another important feature of our algorithm is that it can be used for either non-overlapping or overlapping communities.   We test our algorithm using the LFR benchmark created by Lancichinetti, Fortunato, and Radicchi specifically for the purpose of evaluating such algorithms. Our algorithm can compete with the best of algorithms for both non-overlapping and overlapping communities as found in the comprehensive study of Lancichinetti and Fortunato.},

abstract = {A temporal graph is a graph in which the edge set can change from step to step. The temporal graph exploration problem TEXP is the problem of computing a foremost exploration schedule for a temporal graph, i.e., a temporal walk that starts at a given start node, visits all nodes of the graph, and has the smallest arrival time. We consider only temporal graphs that are connected at each step. For such temporal graphs with {\$}n{\$} nodes, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate TEXP with ratio {\$}O(n{\^{}}{\{}1-\backslashepsilon{\}}){\$} for any {\$}\backslashepsilon{\textgreater}0{\$}. We also provide an explicit construction of temporal graphs that require {\$}\backslashTheta(n{\^{}}2){\$} steps to be explored. We then consider TEXP under the assumption that the underlying graph (i.e. the graph that contains all edges that are present in the temporal graph in at least one step) belongs to a specific class of graphs. Among other results, we show that temporal graphs can be explored in {\$}O(n{\^{}}{\{}1.5{\}} k{\^{}}2 \backslashlog n){\$} steps if the underlying graph has treewidth {\$}k{\$} and in {\$}O(n \backslashlog{\^{}}3 n){\$} steps if the underlying graph is a {\$}2\backslashtimes n{\$} grid. Finally, we show that sparse temporal graphs with regularly present edges can always be explored in {\$}O(n){\$} steps.},

abstract = {Dense subgraphs of sparse graphs (communities), which appear in most real-world complex networks, play an important role in many contexts. Computing them however is generally expen- sive. We propose here a measure of similarities between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed efficiently, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute efficiently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn2) and space O(n2) in the worst case, and in time O(n2 log n) and space O(n2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.},

However, in many real world applications, we may know some prior information that could be useful in detecting the community structures. Specifically, the true community assignments of certain nodes are known in advance. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised community detection approach is proposed based on label propagation, which can utilize prior information to guide the discovery process of community structure. Our algorithm can propagate the labels from the labeled nodes to the whole network nodes. The algorithm is evaluated on several artificial and real-world networks and shows that it is highly effective in recovering communities.},

abstract = {1.Animal social networks are descriptions of social structure which, aside from their intrinsic interest for understanding sociality, can have significant bearing on across many fields of biology. 2.Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data. 3.We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We then discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We follow with an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network. 4.Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the R programming language. 5.We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions. In particular, we highlight the under-exploited potential of experimental manipulations on social networks to address research questions. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {A person's decision to adopt an idea or product is often driven by the decisions of peers, mediated through a network of social ties. A common way of modeling adoption dynamics is to use threshold models, where a node may become an adopter given a high enough rate of contacts with adopted neighbors. We study the dynamics of threshold models that take both the network topology and the timings of contacts into account, using empirical contact sequences as substrates. The models are designed such that adoption is driven by the number of contacts with different adopted neighbors within a chosen time. We find that while some networks support cascades leading to network-level adoption, some do not: the propagation of adoption depends on several factors from the frequency of contacts to burstiness and timing correlations of contact sequences. More specifically, burstiness is seen to suppress cascades sizes when compared to randomised contact timings, while timing correlations between contacts on adjacent links facilitate cascades.},

abstract = {Community discovery in complex networks is an interesting problem with a number of applications, especially in the knowledge extraction task in social and information networks. However, many large networks often lack a particular community organization at a global level. In these cases, traditional graph partitioning algorithms fail to let the latent knowledge embedded in modular structure emerge, because they impose a top-down global view of a network. We propose here a simple local-first approach to community discovery, able to unveil the modular organization of real complex networks. This is achieved by democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding it in its limited view of the global system, i.e. its ego neighborhood, using a label propagation algorithm; finally, the local communities are merged into a global collection. We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art overlapping and non-overlapping community discovery methods, and found that our new method clearly outperforms the others in the quality of the obtained communities, evaluated by using the extracted communities to predict the metadata about the nodes of several real world networks. We also show how our method is deterministic, fully incremental, and has a limited time complexity, so that it can be used on web-scale real networks.},

abstract = {Mixture model and stochastic block model (SBM) for structure discovery employ a broad and flexible definition of vertex classes such that they are able to explore a wide variety of structure. Compared to the existing algorithms based on the SBM (their time complexities are O(mc2), where m and c are the number of edges and clusters), the algorithms of mixture model are capable of dealing with networks with a large number of communities more efficiently due to their O(mc) time complexity. However, the algorithms of mixture model using expectation maximization (EM) technique are still too slow to deal with real million-node networks, since they compute hidden variables on the entire network in each iteration. In this paper, an online variational EM algorithm is designed to improve the efficiency of the EM algorithms. In each iteration, our online algorithm samples a node and estimates its cluster memberships only by its adjacency links, and model parameters are then estimated by the memberships of the sampled node and old model parameters obtained in the previous iteration. The provided online algorithm updates model parameters subsequently by the links of a new sampled node and explores the general structure of massive and growing networks with millions of nodes and hundreds of clusters in hours. Compared to the relevant algorithms on synthetic and real networks, the proposed online algorithm costs less with little or no degradation of accuracy. Results illustrate that the presented algorithm offers a good trade-off between precision and efficiency.},

Specifically, we study dynamic stochastic block models where nodes change their community membership over time, but where edges are generated independently at each time step. In this setting (which is a special case of several existing models), we are able to derive the detectability threshold exactly, as a function of the rate of change and the strength of the communities. Below this threshold, we claim that no algorithm can identify the communities better than chance. We then give two algorithms that are optimal in the sense that they succeed all the way down to this limit. The first uses belief propagation (BP), which gives asymptotically optimal accuracy, and the second is a fast spectral clustering algorithm, based on linearizing the BP equations. We verify our analytic and algorithmic results via numerical simulation, and close with a brief discussion of extensions and open questions.},

abstract = {Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical networks. Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.},

abstract = {The typical task of unsupervised learning is to organize data, for example into clusters, typically disjoint clusters (eg. the K-means algorithm). One would expect (for example) a clustering of books into topics to present overlapping clusters. The situation is even more so in social networks, a source of ever increasing data. Finding the groups or communities in social networks based on interactions between individuals (a measure of similarity) is an unsupervised learning task; and, groups overlap - an individual can be a chess player and a violin player, in which case he would interact with members of both these groups. The problem we address is not that of finding the overlapping clusters, but of comparing two sets of overlapping clusters. Such a task is the basis for comparing two different clusterings, which is important for comparing algorithms with each other or with a ground truth. From the social network point of view, we are particularly interested in quantifying social group evolution - how much the social group structure of a social network changed - by comparing the set of groups at consecutive time intervals. There is significant prior work on comparing sets of disjoint clusters (partitions). When overlap is allowed, the problem becomes considerably more complex owing to the possibility of degeneracies, which we illustrate through examples. We describe three novel definitions of the distance between collections of potentially overlapping sets, and present algorithms for computing those distances. We test our algorithms on diverse data sets: collections composed from social groups in Twitter, Blogosphere and Enron Email data.},

The traditional approaches were always focusing on the node community, while some recent studies have shown great advantage of link community approach which partitions links instead of nodes into communities. We proposed a novel algorithm LBLC (local based link community) to detect link communities in the network based on local information. A local link community can be detected by maximizing a local link fitness function from a seed link, which was ranked by another algorithm previously. The proposed LBLC algorithm has been tested on both synthetic and real world networks, and it has been compared with other link community detecting algorithm. The experimental results showed LBLC achieves significant improvement on link community structure.},

abstract = {Most community detection methods use network topology and edge density to identify optimal communities. However, in these methods, several objects that are connected by high weights may be decomposed into different communities, even when they intuitively belong to a single community. In this case, it is more effective to classify the objects into the same community because they perform important roles in controlling and understanding the network. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose a method of detecting optimal community structures in a complex network using interaction-based edge clustering. Our approach is to consider network topology as well as interaction density when identifying overlapping and hierarchical communities. Additionally, we measure the differences between the quantity and quality of intra- and inter-community interactions to evaluate the quality of the community structure. We test our method on several benchmark networks with known community structures. Additionally, after applying our method to several real-world complex networks, we evaluate our method through comparison with other methods. We find that the community quality and the overlap quality for our method surpass the results of the other methods.},

The probability model assumes that the vertices of the digraph are partitioned into several unobserved (latent) classes and that the probability distribution of the relation between two vertices depends only on the classes to which they belong. A Bayesian estimator based on Gibbs sampling is proposed. The basic model is not identified, because class labels are arbitrary. The resulting identifiability problems are solved by restricting inference to the posterior distributions of invariant functions of the parameters and the vertex class membership. In addition, models are considered where class labels are identified by prior distributions for the class membership of some of the vertices. The model is illustrated by an example from the social networks literature (Kapferer's tailor shop).},

Most existing work has focused on modeling static networks, which represent either a single time snapshot or an aggregate view over time. There has been recent interest in statistical modeling of dynamic networks, which are observed at multiple points in time and offer a richer representation of many complex phenomena. In this paper, we present a state-space model for dynamic networks that extends the well-known stochastic blockmodel for static networks to the dynamic setting. We fit the model in a near-optimal manner using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) augmented with a local search. We demonstrate that the EKF-based algorithm performs competitively with a state-of-the-art algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling but is significantly less computationally demanding.},

When we minimize the generalized map equation over overlapping network partitions, we detect modules that capture flow and determine which nodes at the boundaries between modules should be classified in multiple modules and to what degree. With a novel greedy search algorithm, we find that some networks, for example, the neural network of C.

Here, we formalize for the first time the network change-point detection problem within an online probabilistic learning framework and introduce a method that can reliably solve it. This method combines a generalized hierarchical random graph model with a Bayesian hypothesis test to quantitatively determine if, when, and precisely how a change point has occurred. We analyze the detectability of our method using synthetic data with known change points of different types and magnitudes, and show that this method is more accurate than several previously used alternatives. Applied to two high-resolution evolving social networks, this method identifies a sequence of change points that align with known external "shocks" to these networks.},

We here introduce an efficient method for scanning for resolutions in one such method. Additionally, we introduce the notion of "significance" of a partition, based on subgraph probabilities. Significance is independent of the exact method used, so could also be applied in other methods, and can be interpreted as the gain in encoding a graph by making use of a partition. Using significance, we can determine "good" resolution parameters, which we demonstrate on benchmark networks. Moreover, optimizing significance itself also shows excellent performance.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community structure is one of the key properties of complex networks and plays a crucial role in their topology and function. While an impressive amount of work has been done on the issue of community detection, very little attention has been so far devoted to the investigation of communities in real networks.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present a systematic empirical analysis of the statistical properties of communities in large information, communication, technological, biological, and social networks. We find that the mesoscopic organization of networks of the same category is remarkably similar. This is reflected in several characteristics of community structure, which can be used as "fingerprints" of specific network categories. While community size distributions are always broad, certain categories of networks consist mainly of tree-like communities, while others have denser modules. Average path lengths within communities initially grow logarithmically with community size, but the growth saturates or slows down for communities larger than a characteristic size. This behaviour is related to the presence of hubs within communities, whose roles differ across categories. Also the community embeddedness of nodes, measured in terms of the fraction of links within their communities, has a characteristic distribution for each category.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings, verified by the use of two fundamentally different community detection methods, allow for a classification of real networks and pave the way to a realistic modelling of networks' evolution.},

abstract = {Humans, like almost all animals, are phase-locked to the diurnal cycle. Most of us sleep at night and are active through the day. Because we have evolved to function with this cycle, the circadian rhythm is deeply ingrained and even detectable at the biochemical level. However, within the broader day-night pattern, there are individual differences: e.g., some of us are intrinsically morning-active, while others prefer evenings. In this article, we look at digital daily cycles: circadian patterns of activity viewed through the lens of auto-recorded data of communication and online activity. We begin at the aggregate level, discuss earlier results, and illustrate differences between population-level daily rhythms in different media. Then we move on to the individual level, and show that there is a strong individual-level variation beyond averages: individuals typically have their distinctive daily pattern that persists in time. We conclude by discussing the driving forces behind these signature daily patterns, from personal traits (morningness/eveningness) to variation in activity level and external constraints, and outline possibilities for future research.},

abstract = {In this work we address the problem of detecting overlapping communities in social networks. Because the word "community" is an ambiguous term, it is necessary to quantify what it means to be a community within the context of a particular type of problem. Our interpretation is that this quantification must be done at a minimum of three scales. These scales are at the level of: individual nodes, individual communities, and the network as a whole. Each of these scales involves quantitative features of community structure that are not accurately represented at the other scales, but are important for defining a particular notion of community. Our work focuses on providing sensible ways to quantify what is desired at each of these scales for a notion of community applicable to social networks, and using these models to develop a community detection algorithm. Appealing features of our approach is that it naturally allows for nodes to belong to multiple communities, and is computationally efficient for large networks with low overall edge density. The scaling of the algorithm is {\$}O(N{\~{}}\backslashoverline{\{}k{\^{}}2{\}} + \backslashoverline{\{}N{\_}{\{}com{\}}{\^{}}2{\}}){\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of nodes in the network, {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}N{\_}{\{}com{\}}{\^{}}2{\}}{\$} is the average squared community size, and {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}k{\^{}}2{\}}{\$} is the expected value of a node's degree squared. Although our work focuses on developing a computationally efficient algorithm for overlapping community detection in the context of social networks, our primary contribution is developing a methodology that is highly modular and can easily be adapted to target specific notions of community.},

@article{Casteigts2010,
abstract = {The past few years have seen intensive research efforts carried out in some apparently unrelated areas of dynamic systems -- delay-tolerant networks, opportunistic-mobility networks, social networks -- obtaining closely related insights. Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed as parts of the same conceptual universe; and the formal models proposed so far to express some specific concepts are components of a larger formal description of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on whether the indicators for these properties are a-temporal (as in the majority of existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction of randomness in TVGs.},

abstract = {Most of the existing literature which has entirely focused on clustering nodes in large-scale networks. To discover multi-scale overlapping communities quickly, we propose a highly efficient multi-resolution link community detection algorithm to detect the link communities in massive networks based on the idea of edge labeling. First, we will get the node partition of the network based on a new multi-resolution node detection algorithm. After that, we can find the link community in a linear time by the labels of nodes. Its time complexity is near linear and its space complexity is linear. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by extensive experiments on lots of computer generated artificial graphs and real-world networks. The results show that our algorithm is very fast and highly reliable. Tests on real and artificial networks also give excellent results comparing with the newly proposed link partition algorithm.},

abstract = {Many natural and artificial networks evolve in time. Nodes and connections appear and disappear at various time scales, and their dynamics has profound consequences for any processes in which they are involved. The first empirical analysis of the temporal patterns characterizing dynamic networks are still recent, so that many questions remain open. Here, we study how random walks, as a paradigm of dynamical processes, unfold on temporally evolving networks. To this aim, we use empirical dynamical networks of contacts between individuals, and characterize the fundamental quantities that impact any general process taking place upon them. Furthermore, we introduce different randomizing strategies that allow us to single out the role of the different properties of the empirical networks. We show that the random walk exploration is slower on temporal networks than it is on the aggregate projected network, even when the time is properly rescaled. In particular, we point out that a fundamental role is played by the temporal correlations between consecutive contacts present in the data. Finally, we address the consequences of the intrinsically limited duration of many real world dynamical networks. Considering the fundamental prototypical role of the random walk process, we believe that these results could help to shed light on the behavior of more complex dynamics on temporally evolving networks.},

However, the social networks have communities. In our work, we aim at mining the invisible or missing relations between individuals within a community in social networks. We propose our algorithm according to the fact that the individuals exist in communities satisfying Nash equilibrium, which is borrowed from game-theoretic concepts often used in economic researches. Each hidden relation is explored through the individual's loyalty to their community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the problem of mining hidden links from the aspect of Nash equilibrium.

In this article we present a multi-level algorithm for graph clustering using flows that delivers significant improvements in both quality and speed. The graph is first successively coarsened to a manageable size, and a small number of iterations of flow simulation is performed on the coarse graph. The graph is then successively refined, with flows from the previous graph used as initializations for brief flow simulations on each of the intermediate graphs. When we reach the final refined graph, the algorithm is run to convergence and the high-flow regions are clustered together, with regions without any flow forming the natural boundaries of the clusters. Extensive experimental results on several real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The results from these simulations are compared to reference data where we eliminate structures in the interevent intervals, the time to the first contact in the data, or the time from the last contact to the end of the sampling. The picture we find is that the birth and death of links, and the total number of contacts over a link, are essential to predict outbreaks. On the other hand, the exact times of contacts between the beginning and end, or the interevent interval distribution, do not matter much. In other words, a simplified picture of these empirical data sets that suffices for epidemiological purposes is that links are born, is active with some intensity, and die.},

Additionally, network sampling is lately often applied to large networks to allow for their faster and more efficient analysis. Nevertheless, the changes in network structure introduced by sampling are still far from understood. In this paper, we study the presence of characteristic groups of nodes in sampled social and information networks. We consider different network sampling techniques including random node and link selection, network exploration and expansion. We first observe that the structure of social networks reveals densely linked groups like communities, while the structure of information networks is better described by modules of structurally equivalent nodes. However, despite these notable differences, the structure of sampled networks exhibits stronger characterization by community-like groups than the original networks, irrespective of their type and consistently across various sampling techniques. Hence, rich community structure commonly observed in social and information networks is to some extent merely an artifact of sampling.},

@article{Taylor2015,
abstract = {In the study of static networks, numerous "centrality" measures have been developed to quantify the importances of nodes in networks, and one can express many of these measures in terms of the leading eigenvector of a matrix. With the increasing availability of network data that changes in time, it is important to extend eigenvector-based centrality measures to time-dependent networks. In this paper, we introduce a principled generalization that is valid for any eigenvector-based centrality measure in terms of matrices of size {\$}NT\backslashtimes NT{\$}, where the components of the dominant eigenvector of such a matrix describes the centralities of {\$}N{\$} nodes during {\$}T{\$} time layers. Our approach relies on coupling centrality values between neighboring time layers with a inter-layer edge, whose weight controls the extent to which centrality trajectories change over time. By studying the limit of strong coupling between layers, we derive expressions for "time-averaged centralities," which are given by the zeroth-order terms of a singular perturbation expansion. We also study first-order terms to obtain "first-order-mover scores," which concisely describe the magnitude of nodes' centrality changes over time. Importantly, we compute these quantities by solving linear algebraic equations of dimension {\$}N{\$}. This is much more computationally efficient than computing the dominant eigenvector of the full {\$}NT \backslashtimes NT{\$} matrix. As examples, we apply our method to three empirical temporal networks: the United States Ph.D. exchange in mathematics, costarring relationships among top-billed actors during the Golden Age of Hollywood, and citations of decisions from the Supreme Court of the United States.},

This approach allows for communities to overlap at nodes so that nodes may be in more than one community. We do this by making a node partition of the line graph of the original network. In this way we show that any algorithm that produces a partition of nodes can be used to produce a partition of links. We discuss the role of the degree heterogeneity and propose a weighted version of the line graph in order to account for this.},

abstract = {Complex systems in diverse areas such as biology, sociology and physics are frequently being modelled as graphs, that provide the mathematical framework upon which small scale dynamics between the fundamental elements of the system can reveal large scale system behavior. Community structure in a graph is an important large scale characteristic, and can be described as a natural division of the vertices into densely connected groups, or clusters. Detection of community structure remains up to this date a computationally challenging problem despite the efforts of many researchers from various scientific fields in the past few years. The modularity value of a set of vertex clusters in a graph is a widely used quality measure for community structure, and the relating problem of finding a partition of the vertices into clusters such that the corresponding modularity is maximized is an NP-Hard problem. In this paper we present a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) with path relinking, for solving the modularity maximization problem in weighted graphs. A class of {\{}0,1{\}} matrices is introduced that characterizes the family of clusterings in a graph, and a distance function is given that enables us to define an l-neighborhood local search, which generalizes most of the related local search methods that have appeared in the literature. Computational experiments comparing the proposed algorithm with other heuristics from the literature in a set of artificially generated graphs and some well known benchmark instances, indicate that our implementation of GRASP with path relinking consistently produces better quality solutions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Epidemic outbreaks of new pathogens, or known pathogens in new populations, spread fear much because they are hard to predict. For theoretical models of disease spreading, on the other hand, quantities characterizing the outbreak converge to deterministic functions of time. Our goal in this paper is to shed some light on this apparent discrepancy. We measure the diversity of (and, thus, the predictability of) outbreak sizes and extinction times as functions of time given different scenarios of the amount of information available. Under the assumption of perfect information -- i.e. knowing the state of each individual with respect to the disease -- the predictability decreases exponentially, or faster, with time. The decay is slowest for intermediate values of the per-contact transmission probability. With a weaker assumption on the information available, assuming that we know only the fraction of currently infectious, recovered or susceptible individuals, the predictability also decreases exponentially most of the time. There are, however, some peculiar regions in this scenario where the predictability decreases. In other words, to predict its final size with a given accuracy, we would need increasingly much information about the outbreak.},

abstract = {In temporal networks, both the topology of the underlying network and the timings of interaction events can be crucial in determining how a dynamic process mediated by the network unfolds. We have explored the limiting case of the speed of spreading in the SI model, set up such that an event between an infectious and a susceptible individual always transmits the infection. The speed of this process sets an upper bound for the speed of any dynamic process that is mediated through the interaction events of the network. With the help of temporal networks derived from large-scale time-stamped data on mobile phone calls, we extend earlier results that indicate the slowing-down effects of burstiness and temporal inhomogeneities. In such networks, links are not permanently active, but dynamic processes are mediated by recurrent events taking place on the links at specific points in time. We perform a multiscale analysis and pinpoint the importance of the timings of event sequences on individual links, their correlations with neighboring sequences, and the temporal pathways taken by the network-scale spreading process. This is achieved by studying empirically and analytically different characteristic relay times of links, relevant to the respective scales, and a set of temporal reference models that allow for removing selected time-domain correlations one by one. Our analysis shows that for the spreading velocity, time-domain inhomogeneities are as important as the network topology, which indicates the need to take time-domain information into account when studying spreading dynamics. In particular, results for the different characteristic relay times underline the importance of the burstiness of individual links.},

abstract = {Community detection is important for understanding networks. Previous studies observed that communities are not necessarily disjoint and might overlap. It is also agreed that some outlier vertices participate in no community, and some hubs in a community might take more important roles than others. Each of these facts has been independently addressed in previous work. But there is no algorithm, to our knowledge, that can identify these three structures altogether. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel model where vertices are measured by their centrality in communities, and define the identification of overlapping communities, hubs, and outliers as an optimization problem, calculated by nonnegative matrix factorization. We test this method on various real networks, and compare it with several competing algorithms. The experimental results not only demonstrate its ability of identifying overlapping communities, hubs, and outliers, but also validate its superior performance in terms of clustering quality.},

abstract = {Many methods have been proposed to detect communities, not only in plain, but also in attributed, directed or even dynamic complex networks. In its simplest form, a community structure takes the form of a partition of the node set. From the modeling point of view, to be of some utility, this partition must then be characterized relatively to the properties of the studied system. However, if most of the existing works focus on defining methods for the detection of communities, only very few try to tackle this interpretation problem. Moreover, the existing approaches are limited either in the type of data they handle, or by the nature of the results they output. In this work, we propose a method to efficiently support such a characterization task. We first define a sequence-based representation of networks, combining temporal information, topological measures, and nodal attributes. We then describe how to identify the most emerging sequential patterns of this dataset, and use them to characterize the communities. We also show how to detect unusual behavior in a community, and highlight outliers. Finally, as an illustration, we apply our method to a network of scientific collaborations.},

abstract = {Community detection using both graphs and social networks is the focus of many algorithms. Recent methods aimed at optimizing the so-called modularity function proceed by maximizing relations within communities while minimizing inter-community relations.   However, given the NP-completeness of the problem, these algorithms are heuristics that do not guarantee an optimum. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm along with a function that takes an approximate solution and modifies it in order to reach an optimum. This reassignment function is considered a 'potential function' and becomes a necessary condition to asserting that the computed optimum is indeed a Nash Equilibrium. We also use this function to simultaneously show partitioning and overlapping communities, two detection and visualization modes of great value in revealing interesting features of a social network. Our approach is successfully illustrated through several experiments on either real unipartite, multipartite or directed graphs of medium and large-sized datasets.},

@article{Hillar2015,
abstract = {We present here a novel method for the classical task of extracting reoccurring spatiotemporal patterns from spiking activity of large populations of neurons. In contrast to previous studies that mainly focus on synchrony detection or exactly recurring binary patterns, we perform the search in an approximate way that clusters together nearby, noisy network states in the data. Our approach is to use minimum probability flow (MPF) parameter estimation to determinis- tically fit very large Hopfield networks on windowed spike trains obtained from recordings of spontaneous activity of neurons in cat visual cortex. Examining the structure of the network memories over the spiking activity after training, we find that the networks robustly discover long-range temporal correlations. Specifically, the recurrent network dynamics denoise and group together windowed spike patterns, revealing underlying structure such as cell assemblies. We first demonstrate this by computing an analogy to spike triggered averages that we call memory triggered averages (MTAs). MTAs are obtained by averaging raw spike train windows that converge under the network dynamics to the same memory. The MTAs reveal promi- nent repeating patterns in the data that are difficult to detect with standard methods such as PCA. Additionally, when memories are collected over eight disjoint epochs in 280seconds of windowed spiking activity from 50 neurons, their counts are nearly identical and the networks store significantly more memories than would be possible if trained on random patterns.},

abstract = {The behavior of complex systems is determined not only by the topological organization of their interconnections but also by the dynamical processes taking place among their constituents. A faithful modeling of the dynamics is essential because different dynamical processes may be affected very differently by network topology. A full characterization of such systems thus requires a formalization that encompasses both aspects simultaneously, rather than relying only on the topological adjacency matrix. To achieve this, we introduce the concept of flow graphs, namely weighted networks where dynamical flows are embedded into the link weights. Flow graphs provide an integrated representation of the structure and dynamics of the system, which can then be analyzed with standard tools from network theory. Conversely, a structural network feature of our choice can also be used as the basis for the construction of a flow graph that will then encompass a dynamics biased by such a feature. We illustrate the ideas by focusing on the mathematical properties of generic linear processes on complex networks that can be represented as biased random walks and their dual consensus dynamics, and show how our framework improves our understanding of these processes.},

The conventional approach was partitioning nodes into communities, while some recent studies start partitioning links instead of nodes to find overlapping communities of nodes efficiently. We extended the map equation method, which was originally developed for node communities, to find link communities in networks. This method is tested on various kinds of networks and compared with the metadata of the networks, and the results show that our method can identify the overlapping role of nodes effectively. The advantage of this method is that the node community scheme and link community scheme can be compared quantitatively by measuring the unknown information left in the networks besides the community structure. It can be used to decide quantitatively whether or not the link community scheme should be used instead of the node community scheme. Furthermore, this method can be easily extended to the directed and weighted networks since it is based on the random walk.},

abstract = {The dynamic nature of contact patterns creates diverse temporal structures. In particular, empirical studies have shown that contact patterns follow heterogeneous inter-event time intervals, meaning that periods of high activity are followed by long periods of inactivity. To investigate the impact of these heterogeneities in the spread of infection from a theoretical perspective, we propose a stochastic model to generate temporal networks where vertices make instantaneous contacts following heterogeneous inter-event intervals, and may leave and enter the system. We study how these properties affect the prevalence of an infection and estimate R(0), the number of secondary infections of an infectious individual in a completely susceptible population, by modeling simulated infections (SI and SIR) that co-evolve with the network structure. We find that heterogeneous contact patterns cause earlier and larger epidemics in the SIR model in comparison to homogeneous scenarios for a vast range of parameter values, while smaller epidemics may happen in some combinations of parameters. In the case of SI and heterogeneous patterns, the epidemics develop faster in the earlier stages followed by a slowdown in the asymptotic limit. For increasing vertex turnover rates, heterogeneous patterns generally cause higher prevalence in comparison to homogeneous scenarios with the same average inter-event interval. We find that [Formula: see text] is generally higher for heterogeneous patterns, except for sufficiently large infection duration and transmission probability.},

abstract = {Although community detection has drawn tremendous amount of attention across the sciences in the past decades, no formal consensus has been reached on the very nature of what qualifies a community as such. In this article we take an orthogonal approach by introducing a novel point of view to the problem of overlapping communities. Instead of quantifying the quality of a set of communities, we choose to focus on the intrinsic community-ness of one given set of nodes. To do so, we propose a general metric on graphs, the cohesion, based on counting triangles and inspired by well established sociological considerations. The model has been validated through a large-scale online experiment called Fellows in which users were able to compute their social groups on Face book and rate the quality of the obtained groups. By observing those ratings in relation to the cohesion we assess that the cohesion is a strong indicator of users subjective perception of the community-ness of a set of people.},

abstract = {The past few years have seen intensive research efforts carried out in some apparently unrelated areas of dynamic systems - delay-tolerant networks, opportunistic-mobility networks, social networks - obtaining closely related insights. Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed as parts of the same conceptual universe; and the formal models proposed so far to express some specific concepts can be viewed as fragments of a larger formal description of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to each. Besides this definitional work, we articulate both existing works and original suggestions around three main federative motifs. They are, a hierarchy of classes of TVGs defined with respects to properties that showed algorithmic significance in distributed computing; the problem of analyzing complex dynamic networks, in particular recognizing properties on the network dynamics and capturing emerging phenomena; and finally, the description of some techniques to study dynamic networks from a stochastic, yet analytical, perspective.},

abstract = {Data that encompasses relationships is represented by a graph of interconnected nodes. Social network analysis is the study of such graphs which examines questions related to structures and patterns that can lead to the understanding of the data and predicting the trends of social networks. Static analysis, where the time of interaction is not considered (i.e., the network is frozen in time), misses the opportunity to capture the evolutionary patterns in dynamic networks. Specifically, detecting the community evolutions, the community structures that changes in time, provides insight into the underlying behaviour of the network. Recently, a number of researchers have started focusing on identifying critical events that characterize the evolution of communities in dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we present a framework for modeling and detecting community evolution in social networks, where a series of significant events is defined for each community. A community matching algorithm is also proposed to effciently identify and track similar communities over time. We also define the concept of meta community which is a series of similar communities captured in different timeframes and detected by our matching algorithm. We illustrate the capabilities and potential of our framework by applying it to two real datasets. Furthermore, the events detected by the framework is supplemented by extraction and investigation of the topics discovered for each community.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57{\%}, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {An important problem in the analysis of network data is the detection of groups of densely interconnected nodes also called modules or communities. Community structure reveals functions and organizations of networks. Currently used algorithms for community detection in large-scale real-world networks are computationally expensive or require a priori information such as the number or sizes of communities or are not able to give the same resulting partition in multiple runs. In this paper we investigate a simple and fast algorithm that uses the network structure alone and requires neither optimization of pre-defined objective function nor information about number of communities. We propose a bottom up community detection algorithm in which starting from communities consisting of adjacent pairs of nodes and their maximal similar neighbors we find real communities. We show that the overall advantage of the proposed algorithm compared to the other community detection algorithms is its simple nature, low computational cost and its very high accuracy in detection communities of different sizes also in networks with blurred modularity structure consisting of poorly separated communities. All communities identified by the proposed method for facebook network and E-Coli transcriptional regulatory network have strong structural and functional coherence.},

However, many real networks have more complex overlapping community structures. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to discover overlapping communities. Different from conventional algorithms based on node clustering, the proposed algorithm is based on link clustering. Since links usually represent unique relations among nodes, the link clustering will discover groups of links that have the same characteristics. Thus nodes naturally belong to multiple communities. The algorithm applies genetic operation to cluster on links. An effective encoding schema is designed and the number of communities can be automatically determined. Experiments on both artificial networks and real networks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

This feature is known as community structure and encodes precious information about the organization and the function of the nodes. Many algorithms have been proposed but it is not yet clear how they should be tested. Recently we have proposed a general class of undirected and unweighted benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size. An increasing attention has been recently devoted to develop algorithms able to consider the direction and the weight of the links, which require suitable benchmark graphs for testing. In this paper we extend the basic ideas behind our previous benchmark to generate directed and weighted networks with built-in community structure. We also consider the possibility that nodes belong to more communities, a feature occurring in real systems, such as social networks. As a practical application, we show how modularity optimization performs on our benchmark.},

abstract = {The rich set of interactions between individuals in society results in complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends, families or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution. Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimization of society as a whole. We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency-the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that knowledge of the time commitment of members to a given community can be used for estimating the community's lifetime. These findings offer insight into the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.},

@article{Chakraborty2015,
abstract = {Network communities represent mesoscopic structure for understanding the organization of real-world networks, where nodes often belong to multiple communities and form overlapping community structure in the network. Due to non-triviality in finding the exact boundary of such overlapping communities, this problem has become challenging, and therefore huge effort has been devoted to detect overlapping communities from the network.   In this paper, we present PVOC (Permanence based Vertex-replication algorithm for Overlapping Community detection), a two-stage framework to detect overlapping community structure. We build on a novel observation that non-overlapping community structure detected by a standard disjoint community detection algorithm from a network has high resemblance with its actual overlapping community structure, except the overlapping part. Based on this observation, we posit that there is perhaps no need of building yet another overlapping community finding algorithm; but one can efficiently manipulate the output of any existing disjoint community finding algorithm to obtain the required overlapping structure. We propose a new post-processing technique that by combining with any existing disjoint community detection algorithm, can suitably process each vertex using a new vertex-based metric, called permanence, and thereby finds out overlapping candidates with their community memberships. Experimental results on both synthetic and large real-world networks show that PVOC significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art overlapping community detection algorithms in terms of high similarity of the output with the ground-truth structure. Thus our framework not only finds meaningful overlapping communities from the network, but also allows us to put an end to the constant effort of building yet another overlapping community detection algorithm.},

abstract = {In the study of networks, it is often insightful to use algorithms to determine mesoscale features such as "community structure", in which densely connected sets of nodes constitute "communities" that have sparse connections to other communities. The most popular way of detecting communities algorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When optimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or time-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph ensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes that are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the null model. Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally on the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel null models that take into account appropriate features of the system under study. In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take incorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the radiation model of population spread. We also develop novel synthetic spatial benchmark networks in which the connections between entities are based on distance or flux between nodes, and we compare the performance of both static and time-dependent radiation null models to the standard ("Newman-Girvan") null model for modularity optimization and a recently-proposed gravity null model. In our comparisons, we use both the above synthetic benchmarks and time-dependent correlation networks that we construct using countrywide dengue fever incidence data for Peru. We also evaluate a recently-proposed correlation null model, which was developed specifically for correlation networks that are constructed from time series, on the epidemic-correlation data.},

Rather than preferentially following dominant individuals, baboons are more likely to follow when multiple initiators agree. When conflicts arise over the direction of movement, baboons choose one direction over the other when the angle between them is large, but they compromise if it is not.

abstract = {We investigate the detectability of modules in large networks when the number of modules is not known in advance. We employ the minimum description length (MDL) principle which seeks to minimize the total amount of information required to describe the network, and avoid overfitting. According to this criterion, we obtain general bounds on the detectability of any prescribed block structure, given the number of nodes and edges in the sampled network. We also obtain that the maximum number of detectable blocks scales as {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}N{\}}{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of nodes in the network, for a fixed average degree {\$}{\textless}k{\textgreater}{\$}. We also show that the simplicity of the MDL approach yields an efficient multilevel Monte Carlo inference algorithm with a complexity of {\$}O(\backslashtau N\backslashlog N){\$}, if the number of blocks is unknown, and {\$}O(\backslashtau N){\$} if it is known, where {\$}\backslashtau{\$} is the mixing time of the Markov chain. We illustrate the application of the method on a large network of actors and films with over {\$}10{\^{}}6{\$} edges, and a dissortative, bipartite block structure.},

abstract = {A good knowledge of the specificities of the animal trade network is highly valuable to better control pathogen spread on a large regional to transnational scale. Because of their temporal dynamical nature, studying multi-annual datasets is particularly needed to investigate whether structural patterns are stable over the years. In this study, we analysed the French cattle movement network from 2005 to 2009 for different spatial granularities and temporal windows, with the three-fold objective of exploring temporal variations of the main network characteristics, computing proxies for pathogen spread on this network, which accounts for its time-varying properties and identifying specificities related to the main types of animals and farms (dairy versus beef). Network properties did not qualitatively vary among different temporal and spatial granularities. About 40{\%} of the holdings and 80{\%} of the communes were directly interconnected. The width of the aggregation time window barely impacted normalised distributions of indicators. A period of 8 to 16 weeks would suffice for robust estimation of their main trends, whereas longer periods would provide more details on tails. The dynamic nature of the network could be seen through the small overlap between consecutive networks with 65{\%} of common active nodes for only 3{\%} of common links over 2005-2009. To control pathogen spread on such a network, by reducing the largest strongly connected component by more than 80{\%}, movements should be prevented from 1 to 5{\%} of the holdings with the highest centrality in the previous year network. The analysis of breed-wise and herd-wise subnetworks, dairy, beef and mixed, reveals similar trends in temporal variation of average indicators and their distributions. The link-based backbones of beef subnetworks seem to be more stable over time than those of other subnetworks. At a regional scale, node reachability accounting for time-respecting paths, as proxy of epidemic burden, is greater for a dairy region than for a beef region. This highlights the importance of considering local specificities and temporal dynamics of animal trade networks when evaluating control measures of pathogen spread.},

abstract = {Many networks are dynamic in that their topology changes rapidly—on the same time scale as the communications of interest between network nodes. Examples are the human contact networks involved in the transmission of disease, ad hoc radio networks between moving vehicles, and the transactions between principals in a market. While we have good models of static networks, so far these have been lacking for the dynamic case. In this paper we present a simple but powerful model, the time-ordered graph, which reduces a dynamic network to a static network with directed flows. This enables us to extend network properties such as vertex degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality metrics in a very natural way to the dynamic case. We then demonstrate how our model applies to a number of interesting edge cases, such as where the network connectivity depends on a small number of highly mobile vertices or edges, and show that our centrality definition allows us to track the evolution of connectivity. Finally we apply our model and techniques to two real-world dynamic graphs of human contact networks and then discuss the implication of temporal centrality metrics in the real world.},

abstract = {Detecting the time evolution of the community structure of networks is crucial to identify major changes in the internal organization of many complex systems, which may undergo important endogenous or exogenous events. This analysis can be done in twoways: considering each snapshot as an independent community detection problem or taking into account the whole evolution of the network. In the first case, one can apply staticmethods on the temporal snapshots, which correspond to configurations of the system in short time windows, and match afterward the communities across layers. Alternatively, one can develop dedicated dynamic procedures so that multiple snapshots are simultaneously taken into account while detecting communities, which allows us to keep memory of the flow. To check howwell a method of any kind could capture the evolution of communities, suitable benchmarks are needed. Here we propose a model for generating simple dynamic benchmark graphs, based on stochastic block models. In them, the time evolution consists of a periodic oscillation of the system's structure between configurations with built-in community structure.We also propose the extension of quality comparison indices to the dynamic scenario.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering C to clustering C′. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only "sensible" criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Or, beaucoup de r{\'{e}}seaux de terrains sont en fait dynamiques, ils {\'{e}}voluent au cours du temps. L'apport principal de cette th{\`{e}}se est donc la conception d'un algorithme de d{\'{e}}tection de communaut{\'{e}}s dynamiques sur des r{\'{e}}seaux temporels.

Many models for such opportunistic networks are under a homogeneous assumption that the distribution from every pair of agents performs the same format as that from all pairs of agents. But our empirical study shows an opposite scenario, e.g., each agent performs Poissonian dynamics while all pairs perform burst dynamics. Therefore, we propose a bottom-up human mobility model to replicate this opportunistic network, and prove that bursts of aggregate pairs can be rooted from individual independent Poissonian self-activity and preferential mobility. Finally we validate our findings with numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Nodes in real-world networks are repeatedly observed to form dense clusters, often referred to as communities. Methods to detect these groups of nodes usually maximize an objective function, which implicitly contains the definition of a community. We here analyze a recently proposed measure called Surprise, which assesses the quality of the partition of a network into communities. Given that, in its current form, its formulation is rather difficult to analyze, we develop an accurate asymptotic approximation. This allows for the development of an efficient algorithm for optimizing Surprise. Incidentally, this leads to a straightforward extension of Surprise to weighted graphs. Finally, we analytically compare it to previous methods, which makes clear that Surprise is more discriminative than ER Modularity. Furthermore, we show that it is especially suited for detecting relatively small communities in large graphs, an area where some earlier methods fail.},

Finding out the explanations behind the phenomena that networked systems can still function efficiently after some structural damages or the malfunction of certain nodes is meaningful to both the design of solid systems and the defend against failures. It is still indistinct what kind of resilience networked systems which change their topological structures incessantly over time might have. Nevertheless, earlier studies have frequently overlooked to consider the temporal characteristics which in many real scenarios are of great concern, or have considered only the temporality without spatiality which is not reasonable in the real world case. In this paper, we first take the spatiality of connections and communications between nodes, except for the temporal ordering of connection events which has solely been noticed by previous studies, into consideration for measuring and assessing the robustness of the temporal network. We propose a novel temporal efficiency metric, and correspondingly, develop a new temporal robustness evaluation method for temporal network models. The proposed metric and method show their validity through numerical simulations of three temporal network models and we give our evaluations and discussions.},

abstract = {Along with the development of internet, our personal online social networks become bigger and more jumbled than before, and it is necessary to provide a good way to organize them. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g., ‘list' on Facebook and Twitter), but it is laborious. The problem of social circles identifying is thus posed on a user's ego network, while there are currently few efficient as well as effective methods to identify user's social circles. In this paper, we propose a new method, named enhanced link clustering, for social circles identifying on ego networks. The proposed method integrates node profile and network structure by constructing an edge profile for each edge. Utilization of both node profile and network structure information makes the proposed method more effective. Taking edge similarity instead of node similarity to discriminate nodes into different circles allows us to detect overlapping circles. Moreover, we observe that nodes in one circle appear transitive similarity and some nodes are only densely connected, or share common properties. These observations make the process of edge clustering efficient. Experiments on several real datasets demonstrate that our method is much faster, and also more effective compared with maximization likelihood-like method, which has been proved to dominate most methods.},

Temporal motifs are classes of similar event sequences, where the similarity refers not only to topology but also to the temporal order of the events.

abstract = {We develop a framework to track the structure of temporal networks with a signal processing approach. The method is based on the duality between networks and signals using a multidimensional scaling technique. This enables a study of the network structure using frequency patterns of the corresponding signals. An extension is proposed for temporal networks, thereby enabling a tracking of the network structure over time. A method to automatically extract the most significant frequency patterns and their activation coefficients over time is then introduced, using nonnegative matrix factorization of the temporal spectra. The framework, inspired by audio decomposition, allows transforming back these frequency patterns into networks, to highlight the evolution of the underlying structure of the network over time. The effectiveness of the method is first evidenced on a toy example, prior being used to study a temporal network of face-to-face contacts. The extraction of sub-networks highlights significant structures decomposed on time intervals.},

abstract = {We are interested in tracking changes in large-scale data by periodically creating an agglomerative clustering and examining the evolution of clusters (communities) over time. We examine a large real-world data set: the NEC CiteSeer database, a linked network of {\textgreater}250,000 papers. Tracking changes over time requires a clustering algorithm that produces clusters stable under small perturbations of the input data. However, small perturbations of the CiteSeer data lead to significant changes to most of the clusters. One reason for this is that the order in which papers within communities are combined is somewhat arbitrary. However, certain subsets of papers, called natural communities, correspond to real structure in the CiteSeer database and thus appear in any clustering. By identifying the subset of clusters that remain stable under multiple clustering runs, we get the set of natural communities that we can track over time. We demonstrate that such natural communities allow us to identify emerging communities and track temporal changes in the underlying structure of our network data.},

Many methods have been proposed to shed light on this problem, and most of these have focused on discovering node community. However, link community is also a powerful framework for discovering overlapping communities. Here we present a novel edge label propagation algorithm (ELPA), which combines the natural advantage of link communities with the efficiency of the label propagation algorithm (LPA). ELPA can discover both link communities and node communities. We evaluated ELPA on both synthetic and real-world networks, and compared it with five state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that ELPA performs competitively with other algorithms.},

@article{Mitrovic2009,
abstract = {We study structure, eigenvalue spectra, and random-walk dynamics in a wide class of networks with subgraphs (modules) at mesoscopic scale. The networks are grown within the model with three parameters controlling the number of modules, their internal structure as scale-free and correlated subgraphs, and the topology of connecting network. Within the exhaustive spectral analysis for both the adjacency matrix and the normalized Laplacian matrix we identify the spectral properties, which characterize the mesoscopic structure of sparse cyclic graphs and trees. The minimally connected nodes, the clustering, and the average connectivity affect the central part of the spectrum. The number of distinct modules leads to an extra peak at the lower part of the Laplacian spectrum in cyclic graphs. Such a peak does not occur in the case of topologically distinct tree subgraphs connected on a tree whereas the associated eigenvectors remain localized on the subgraphs both in trees and cyclic graphs. We also find a characteristic pattern of periodic localization along the chains on the tree for the eigenvector components associated with the largest eigenvalue lambda(L)=2 of the Laplacian. Further differences between the cyclic modular graphs and trees are found by the statistics of random walks return times and hitting patterns at nodes on these graphs. The distribution of first-return times averaged over all nodes exhibits a stretched exponential tail with the exponent sigma approximately 1/3 for trees and sigma approximately 2/3 for cyclic graphs, which is independent of their mesoscopic and global structure.},

abstract = {Several approaches have recently been pro- posed for modeling of continuous-time net- work data via dyadic event rates condi- tioned on the observed history of events and nodal or dyadic covariates. In many cases, however, interaction propensities — and even the underlying mechanisms of in- teraction — vary systematically across sub- groups whose identities are unobserved. For static networks such heterogeneity has been treated via methods such as stochastic block- modeling, which operate by assuming latent groups of individuals with similar tenden- cies in their group-wise interactions. Here we combine ideas from stochastic blockmod- eling and continuous-time network models by positing a latent partition of the node set such that event dynamics within and between subsets evolve in potentially distinct ways. We illustrate the use of our model family by application to several forms of dyadic inter- action data, including email communication and Twitter direct messages. Parameter es- timates from the fitted models clearly reveal heterogeneity in the dynamics among groups of individuals. We also find that the fitted models have better predictive accuracy than both baseline models and relational event models that lack latent structure.},

@article{Ruan2012,
abstract = {In this paper we discuss a very simple approach of combining content and link information in graph structures for the purpose of community discovery, a fundamental task in network analysis. Our approach hinges on the basic intuition that many networks contain noise in the link structure and that content information can help strengthen the community signal. This enables ones to eliminate the impact of noise (false positives and false negatives), which is particularly prevalent in online social networks and Web-scale information networks.   Specifically we introduce a measure of signal strength between two nodes in the network by fusing their link strength with content similarity. Link strength is estimated based on whether the link is likely (with high probability) to reside within a community. Content similarity is estimated through cosine similarity or Jaccard coefficient. We discuss a simple mechanism for fusing content and link similarity. We then present a biased edge sampling procedure which retains edges that are locally relevant for each graph node. The resulting backbone graph can be clustered using standard community discovery algorithms such as Metis and Markov clustering.   Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets (Flickr, Wikipedia and CiteSeer) with varying sizes and characteristics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods over state-of-the-art learning and mining approaches several of which also attempt to combine link and content analysis for the purposes of community discovery. Specifically we always find a qualitative benefit when combining content with link analysis. Additionally our biased graph sampling approach realizes a quantitative benefit in that it is typically several orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches.},

Non-Markovian characteristics resulting from the ordering of interactions in temporal networks were identified as one important mechanism that alters causality and affects dynamical processes. So far, an analytical explanation for this phenomenon and for the significant variations observed across different systems is missing. Here we introduce a methodology that allows to analytically predict causality-driven changes of diffusion speed in non-Markovian temporal networks. Validating our predictions in six data sets we show that compared with the time-aggregated network, non-Markovian characteristics can lead to both a slow-down or speed-up of diffusion, which can even outweigh the decelerating effect of community structures in the static topology. Thus, non-Markovian properties of temporal networks constitute an important additional dimension of complexity in time-varying complex systems.},

We use these events to characterize complex behavioral patterns of individuals and communities over time.

In this chapter, we develop a mathematical framework for random walks on temporal networks using an approach that provides a compromise between abstract but unrealistic models and data-driven but non-mathematical approaches. To do this, we introduce a stochastic model for temporal networks in which we summarize the temporal and structural organization of a system using a matrix of waiting-time distributions. We show that random walks on stochastic temporal networks can be described exactly by an integro-differential master equation and derive an analytical expression for its asymptotic steady state. We also discuss how our work might be useful to help build centrality measures for temporal networks.},

Specifically, we consider the use of statistical null models for facilitating the principled identification of structural modules in semi-decomposable systems. Null models play an important role both in the optimization of quality functions such as modularity and in the subsequent assessment of the statistical validity of identified community structure. We examine the sensitivity of such methods to model parameters and show how comparisons to null models can help identify system scales. By considering a large number of optimizations, we quantify the variance of network diagnostics over optimizations (`optimization variance') and over randomizations of network structure (`randomization variance'). Because the modularity quality function typically has a large number of nearly-degenerate local optima for networks constructed using real data, we develop a method to construct representative partitions that uses a null model to correct for statistical noise in sets of partitions. To illustrate our results, we employ ensembles of time-dependent networks extracted from both nonlinear oscillators and empirical neuroscience data.},

abstract = {The ever increasing adoption of mobile technologies and ubiquitous services allows to sense human behavior at unprecedented levels of details and scale. Wearable sensors are opening up a new window on human mobility and proximity at the finest resolution of face-to-face proximity. As a consequence, empirical data describing social and behavioral networks are acquiring a longitudinal dimension that brings forth new challenges for analysis and modeling. Here we review recent work on the representation and analysis of temporal networks of face-to-face human proximity, based on large-scale datasets collected in the context of the SocioPatterns collaboration. We show that the raw behavioral data can be studied at various levels of coarse-graining, which turn out to be complementary to one another, with each level exposing different features of the underlying system. We briefly review a generative model of temporal contact networks that reproduces some statistical observables. Then, we shift our focus from surface statistical features to dynamical processes on empirical temporal networks. We discuss how simple dynamical processes can be used as probes to expose important features of the interaction patterns, such as burstiness and causal constraints. We show that simulating dynamical processes on empirical temporal networks can unveil differences between datasets that would otherwise look statistically similar. Moreover, we argue that, due to the temporal heterogeneity of human dynamics, in order to investigate the temporal properties of spreading processes it may be necessary to abandon the notion of wall-clock time in favour of an intrinsic notion of time for each individual node, defined in terms of its activity level. We conclude highlighting several open research questions raised by the nature of the data at hand.},

Because of its relevance and availability, written correspondence provides a powerful proxy for studying human activity. One school of thought is that human correspondence is driven by responses to received correspondence, a view that requires a distinct response mechanism to explain e-mail and letter correspondence observations. We demonstrate that, like e-mail correspondence, the letter correspondence patterns of 16 writers, performers, politicians, and scientists are well described by the circadian cycle, task repetition, and changing communication needs. We confirm the universality of these mechanisms by rescaling letter and e-mail correspondence statistics to reveal their underlying similarity.},

abstract = {Humans are heterogenous and the behaviors of individuals could be different from that at the population level. We conduct an in-depth study of the temporal patterns of cellphone conversation activities of 73'339 anonymous cellphone users with the same truncated Weibull distribution of inter-call durations. We find that the individual call events exhibit a pattern of bursts, in which high activity periods are alternated with low activity periods. Surprisingly, the number of events in high activity periods are found to conform to a power-law distribution at the population level, but follow an exponential distribution at the individual level, which is a hallmark of absence of memory in individual call activities. Such exponential distribution is also observed for the number of events in low activity periods. Together with the exponential distributions of inter-call durations within bursts and of the intervals between consecutive bursts, we demonstrate that the individual call activities are driven by two independent Poisson processes, which can be combined within a minimal model in terms of a two-state first-order Markov chain giving very good agreement with the empirical distributions using the parameters estimated from real data for about half of the individuals in our sample. By measuring directly the distributions of call rates across the population, which exhibit power-law tails, we explain the difference with previous population level studies, purporting the existence of power-law distributions, via the "Superposition of Distributions" mechanism: The superposition of many exponential distributions of activities with a power-law distribution of their characteristic scales leads to a power-law distribution of the activities at the population level.},

All methods are evaluated on a set of 100 Facebook social networks with respect to network properties including diameter, connected components, community structure, and multiple node centrality measures. Experiments with our implementations of the sparsification methods (using the open-source network analysis tool suite NetworKit) show that many network properties can be preserved down to about 20$\backslash${\%} of the original set of edges. Furthermore, the experimental results allow us to differentiate the behavior of different methods and show which method is suitable with respect to which property. Our Local Degree method is fast enough for large-scale networks and performs well across a wider range of properties than previously proposed methods.},

abstract = {Community detection is an important task in network analysis. A community (also referred to as a cluster) is a set of cohesive vertices that have more connections inside the set than outside. In many social and information networks, these communities naturally overlap. For instance, in a social network, each vertex in a graph corresponds to an individual who usually participates in multiple communities. One of the most successful techniques for finding overlapping communities is based on local optimization and expansion of a community metric around a seed set of vertices. In this paper, we propose an efficient overlapping community detection algorithm using a seed set expansion approach. In particular, we develop new seeding strategies for a personalized PageRank scheme that optimizes the conductance community score. The key idea of our algorithm is to find good seeds, and then expand these seed sets using the personalized PageRank clustering procedure. Experimental results show that this seed set expansion approach outperforms other state-of-the-art overlapping community detection methods. We also show that our new seeding strategies are better than previous strategies, and are thus effective in finding good overlapping clusters in a graph.},

Recently, there are many studies which focus on discovering communities successively from consecutive snapshots by considering both the current and historical information. However, these methods cannot provide us with much historical or successive information related to the detected communities. Different from previous studies which focus on community detection in dynamic networks, we define a new problem of tracking the progression of the community strength - a novel measure that reflects the community robustness and coherence throughout the entire observation period. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel framework which formulates the problem as an optimization task. The proposed community strength analysis also provides foundation for a wide variety of related applications such as discovering how the strength of each detected community changes over the entire observation period. To demonstrate that the proposed method provides precise and meaningful evolutionary patterns of communities which are not directly obtainable from traditional methods, we perform extensive experimental studies on one synthetic and five real datasets: social evolution, tweeting interaction, actor relationships, bibliography and biological datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is highly effective in discovering the progression of community strengths and detecting interesting communities.},

However, most existing approaches do not scale to the size of networks that we regularly observe in the real world. In this paper, we develop a scalable approach to community detection that discovers overlapping communities in massive real-world networks. Our approach is based on a Bayesian model of networks that allows nodes to participate in multiple communities, and a corresponding algorithm that naturally interleaves subsampling from the network and updating an estimate of its communities. We demonstrate how we can discover the hidden community structure of several real-world networks, including 3.7 million US patents, 575,000 physics articles from the arXiv preprint server, and 875,000 connected Web pages from the Internet. Furthermore, we demonstrate on large simulated networks that our algorithm accurately discovers the true community structure.

abstract = {Networks could be modeled as graphs, where nodes (or vertices) represent the objects and edges (or links) represent the interactions among these objects. The flexibility of networks to present numerous real world complicated systems, admitting those undergoing dynamic shifts of their structure, is establishing a raising concern in the field of their topological characteristics. The detection of dynamic community structure, that is, the organization of nodes into groups having numerous connections within the identical cluster and comparatively sparse connections among vertices of various communities is a serious problem. Automated dynamic approach is necessary to understand dynamic evolution of communities within the multimode network. In this paper, a generalized framework for dynamic evolution of communities within multimodal network is identified using genetic approach. This framework uses genetics based evolutionary approach for dynamic clustering effects of interacted modes and shows how attributes are taken for updating communities of one mode. The proposed approach evaluates how well the dynamic clusters can be constructed within the information by reducing the temporal cost, which evaluates the distance among two clustering at succeeding time steps. Simulation results signify the benefits of the proposed dynamic approach in both synthetic and the real life networks with the capacity of the multi-objective genetic method to properly determine evolutionary communities with solutions aggressive.},

Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e., the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks. Here we introduce a class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes. We use this benchmark to test two popular methods of community detection, modularity optimization, and Potts model clustering. The results show that the benchmark poses a much more severe test to algorithms than standard benchmarks, revealing limits that may not be apparent at a first analysis.},

abstract = {Discovery of natural groups of similarly functioning individuals is a key task in analysis of real world networks. Also, overlap between community pairs is commonplace in large social and biological graphs, in particular. In fact, overlaps between communities are known to be denser than the non-overlapped regions of the communities. However, most of the existing algorithms that detect overlapping communities assume that the communities are denser than their surrounding regions, and falsely identify overlaps as communities. Further, many of these algorithms are computationally demanding and thus, do not scale reasonably with varying network sizes. In this article, we propose FOCS (Fast Overlapped Community Search), an algorithm that accounts for local connectedness in order to identify overlapped communities. FOCS is shown to be linear in number of edges and nodes. It additionally gains in speed via simultaneous selection of multiple near-best communities rather than merely the best, at each iteration. FOCS outperforms some popular overlapped community finding algorithms in terms of computational time while not compromising with quality.},

abstract = {Structure of real networked systems, such as social relationship, can be modeled as temporal networks in which each edge appears only at the prescribed time. Understanding the structure of temporal networks requires quantifying the importance of a temporal vertex, which is a pair of vertex index and time. In this paper, we define two centrality measures of a temporal vertex by the proportion of (normal) vertex pairs, the quickest routes between which can (or should) use the temporal vertex. The definition is free from parameters and robust against the change in time scale on which we focus. In addition, we can efficiently compute these centrality values for all temporal vertices. Using the two centrality measures, we reveal that distributions of these centrality values of real-world temporal networks are heterogeneous. For various datasets, we also demonstrate that a majority of the highly central temporal vertices are located within a narrow time window around a particular time. In other words, there is a bottleneck time at which most information sent in the temporal network passes through a small number of temporal vertices, which suggests an important role of these temporal vertices in spreading phenomena.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of Web 2.0 and the rise of online social networks, finding community structures from user data has become a hot topic in network analysis. Although research achievements are numerous at present, most of these achievements cannot be adopted in large-scale social networks because of heavy computation. Previous studies have shown that label propagation is an efficient means to detect communities in social networks and is easy to implement; however, some drawbacks, such as low accuracy, high randomness, and the formation of a “monster” community, have been found. In this study, we propose an efficient community detection method based on the label propagation algorithm (LPA) with community kernel (CK-LPA). We assign a corresponding weight to each node according to node importance in the whole network and update node labels in sequence based on weight. Then, we discuss the composition of weights, the label updating strategy, the label propagation strategy, and the convergence conditions. Compared with the primitive LPA, existing drawbacks are solved by CK-LPA. Experiments and benchmarks reveal that our proposed method sustains nearly linear time complexity and exhibits significant improvements in the quality aspect of static community detection. Hence, the algorithm can be applied in large-scale social networks.},

The method exploits spectral properties of the graph Laplacian-matrix combined with hierarchical-clustering techniques, and includes a procedure to maximize the "modularity" of the output. Its performance is compared with that of other existing methods, as applied to different well-known instances of complex networks with a community-structure: both computer-generated and from the real-world. Our results are in all the tested cases, at least, as good as the best ones obtained with any other methods, and faster in most of the cases than methods providing similar-quality results. This converts the algorithm in a valuable computational tool for detecting and analyzing communities and modular structures in complex networks.},

Here we propose a general, flexible, and interpretable generative model for overlapping communities, which can be thought of as a generalization of the degree-corrected stochastic block model. We develop an efficient spectral algorithm for estimating the community memberships, which deals with the overlaps by employing the K-medians algorithm rather than the usual K-means for clustering in the spectral domain. We show that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent when networks are not too sparse and the overlaps between communities not too large. Numerical experiments on both simulated networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs very well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community detection.},

Community detection is an important problem in the field of complex networks and is useful in a variety of applications such as information propagation, link prediction, recommendation, and marketing. In this study, we focus on discovering overlapping community structures by using link partitions. We propose a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-Based Link Partition (LBLP) method, which can find communities with an adjustable range of overlapping. This method employs the LDA model to detect link partitions, which can calculate the community belonging factor for each link. On the basis of this factor, link partitions with bridge links can be found efficiently. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution by using both real-world and synthesized networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach can find a meaningful and relevant link community structure.},

@article{Takaguchi2012,
abstract = {Records of time-stamped social interactions between pairs of individuals (e.g. face-to-face conversations, e-mail exchanges and phone calls) constitute a so-called temporal network. A remarkable difference between temporal networks and conventional static networks is that time-stamped events rather than links are the unit elements generating the collective behavior of nodes. We propose an importance measure for single interaction events. By generalizing the concept of the advance of events proposed by Kossinets et al (2008 Proc. 14th ACM SIGKDD Int. Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining p 435), we propose that an event is central when it carries new information about others to the two nodes involved in the event. We find that the proposed measure properly quantifies the importance of events in connecting nodes along time-ordered paths. Because of strong heterogeneity in the importance of events present in real data, a small fraction of highly important events is necessary and sufficient to sustain the connectivity of temporal networks. Nevertheless, in contrast to the behavior of scale-free networks against link removal, this property mainly results from bursty activity patterns and not heterogeneous degree distributions.},

The algorithm is based on the label propagation technique of Raghavan, Albert, and Kumara, but is able to detect communities that overlap. Like the original algorithm, vertices have labels that propagate between neighbouring vertices so that members of a community reach a consensus on their community membership. Our main contribution is to extend the label and propagation step to include information about more than one community: each vertex can now belong to up to v communities, where v is the parameter of the algorithm. Our algorithm can also handle weighted and bipartite networks. Tests on an independently designed set of benchmarks, and on real networks, show the algorithm to be highly effective in recovering overlapping communities. It is also very fast and can process very large and dense networks in a short time.},

Given a set of true clusters, and the set of clusters found by an algorithm, these sets of clusters must be compared to see how similar or different the sets are. A normalized measure is desirable in many contexts, for example assigning a value of 0 where the two sets are totally dissimilar, and 1 where they are identical. A measure based on normalized mutual information, [1], has recently become popular. We demonstrate unintuitive behaviour of this measure, and show how this can be corrected by using a more conventional normalization. We compare the results to that of other measures, such as the Omega index [2]. A C++ implementation is available online.},

abstract = {Discovery of communities in complex networks is a fundamental data analysis problem with applications in various domains. While most of the existing approaches have focused on discovering communities of nodes, recent studies have shown the advantages and uses of link community discovery in networks. Generative models provide a promising class of techniques for the identification of modular structures in networks, but most generative models mainly focus on the detection of node communities rather than link communities. In this work, we propose a generative model, which is based on the importance of each node when forming links in each community, to describe the structure of link communities. We proceed to fit the model parameters by taking it as an optimization problem, and solve it using nonnegative matrix factorization. Thereafter, in order to automatically determine the number of communities, we extend the above method by introducing a strategy of iterative bipartition. This extended method not only finds the number of communities all by itself, but also obtains high efficiency, and thus it is more suitable to deal with large and unexplored real networks. We test this approach on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks including an application on a large biological network, and compare it with two highly related methods. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over competing methods for the detection of link communities.},

abstract = {Multiplex networks, a special type of multilayer networks, are increasingly applied in many domains ranging from social media analytics to biology. A common task in these applications concerns the detection of community structures. Many existing algorithms for community detection in multiplexes attempt to detect communities which are shared by all layers. In this article we propose a community detection algorithm, LART (Locally Adaptive Random Transitions), for the detection of communities that are shared by either some or all the layers in the multiplex. The algorithm is based on a random walk on the multiplex, and the transition probabilities defining the random walk are allowed to depend on the local topological similarity between layers at any given node so as to facilitate the exploration of communities across layers. Based on this random walk, a node dissimilarity measure is derived and nodes are clustered based on this distance in a hierarchical fashion. We present experimental results using networks simulated under various scenarios to showcase the performance of LART in comparison to related community detection algorithms.},

abstract = {Sexual contact patterns, both in their temporal and network structure, can influence the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STI). Most previous literature has focused on effects of network topology; few studies have addressed the role of temporal structure. We simulate disease spread using SI and SIR models on an empirical temporal network of sexual contacts in high-end prostitution. We compare these results with several other approaches, including randomization of the data, classic mean-field approaches, and static network simulations. We observe that epidemic dynamics in this contact structure have well-defined, rather high epidemic thresholds. Temporal effects create a broad distribution of outbreak sizes, even if the per-contact transmission probability is taken to its hypothetical maximum of 100{\%}. In general, we conclude that the temporal correlations of our network accelerate outbreaks, especially in the early phase of the epidemics, while the network topology (apart from the contact-rate distribution) slows them down. We find that the temporal correlations of sexual contacts can significantly change simulated outbreaks in a large empirical sexual network. Thus, temporal structures are needed alongside network topology to fully understand the spread of STIs. On a side note, our simulations further suggest that the specific type of commercial sex we investigate is not a reservoir of major importance for HIV.},

abstract = {Community discovery in complex networks is an interesting problem with a number of applications, especially in the knowledge extraction task in social and information networks. However, many large networks often lack a particular community organization at a global level. In these cases, traditional graph partitioning algorithms fail to let the latent knowledge embedded in modular structure emerge, because they impose a top-down global view of a network. We propose here a simple local-first approach to community discovery, able to unveil the modular organization of real complex networks. This is achieved by democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding it in its limited view of the global system, i.e. its ego neighborhood, using a label propagation algorithm; finally, the local communities are merged into a global collection. We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art overlapping and non-overlapping community discovery methods, and found that our new method clearly outperforms the others in the quality of the obtained communities, evaluated by using the extracted communities to predict the metadata about the nodes of several real world networks. We also show how our method is deterministic, fully incremental, and has a limited time complexity, so that it can be used on web-scale real networks.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

abstract = {Community finding algorithms for networks have recently been extended to dynamic data. Most of these recent methods aim at exhibiting community partitions from successive graph snapshots and thereafter connecting or smoothing these partitions using clever time-dependent features and sampling techniques. These approaches are nonetheless achieving longitudinal rather than dynamic community detection. We assume that communities are fundamentally defined by the repetition of interactions among a set of nodes over time. According to this definition, analyzing the data by considering successive snapshots induces a significant loss of information: we suggest that it blurs essentially dynamic phenomena—such as communities based on repeated inter-temporal interactions, nodes switching from a community to another across time, or the possibility that a community survives while its members are being integrally replaced over a longer time period. We propose a formalism which aims at tackling this issue in the context of time-directed datasets (such as citation networks), and present several illustrations of both empirical and synthetic dynamic networks. We eventually introduce intrinsically dynamic metrics to qualify temporal community structure and emphasize their possible role as an estimator of the quality of the community detection—taking into account the fact that various empirical contexts may call for distinct ‘community' definitions and detection criteria.},

Many algorithms have been proposed so far, but none of them has been subjected to strict tests to evaluate their performance. Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom, Blondel et al. and Ronhovde and Nussinov, respectively, have an excellent performance, with the additional advantage of low computational complexity, which enables one to analyze large systems.},

Many methods have been developed to unveil community structures, but only a few studies have probed their suitability in incomplete networks. Here we assess the accuracy of community detection techniques in incomplete networks generated in sampling processes. We show that the walktrap and fast greedy algorithms are highly accurate for detecting the modular structure of incomplete complex networks even if many of their nodes are removed. Furthermore, we implemented an approach that improved the time performance of the walktrap and fast greedy algorithms, while retaining the accuracy rate in identifying the community membership of nodes. Taken together our results show that this new approach can be applied to speed up virtually any community detection method in dense complex networks, as is the case for similarity networks.},

However, many real networks have more complex overlapping community structures. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to discover overlapping communities. Different from conventional algorithms based on node clustering, the proposed algorithm is based on link clustering. Since links usually represent unique relations among nodes, the link clustering will discover groups of links that have the same characteristics. Thus nodes naturally belong to multiple communities. The algorithm applies genetic operation to cluster on links. An effective encoding schema is designed and the number of communities can be automatically determined. Experiments on both artificial networks and real networks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Crown Copyright ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {High-density living is often associated with high disease risk due to density-dependent epidemic spread. Despite being paragons of high-density living, the social insects have largely decoupled the association with density-dependent epidemics. It is hypothesized that this is accomplished through prophylactic and inducible defenses termed 'collective immunity'. Here we characterise segregation of carpenter ants that would be most likely to encounter infectious agents (i.e. foragers) using integrated social, spatial, and temporal analyses. Importantly, we do this in the absence of disease to establish baseline colony organization. Behavioural and social network analyses show that active foragers engage in more trophallaxis interactions than their nest worker and queen counterparts and occupy greater area within the nest. When the temporal ordering of social interactions is taken into account, active foragers and inactive foragers are not observed to interact with the queen in ways that could lead to the meaningful transfer of disease. Furthermore, theoretical resource spread analyses show that such temporal segregation does not appear to impact the colony-wide flow of food. This study provides an understanding of a complex society's organization in the absence of disease that will serve as a null model for future studies in which disease is explicitly introduced.},

The temporal variation in networks' connectivity patterns and the ongoing dynamic processes are usually coupled in ways that still challenge our mathematical or computational modelling. Here we analyse a mobile call dataset and find a simple statistical law that characterize the temporal evolution of users' egocentric networks. We encode this observation in a reinforcement process defining a time-varying network model that exhibits the emergence of strong and weak ties. We study the effect of time-varying and heterogeneous interactions on the classic rumour spreading model in both synthetic, and real-world networks. We observe that strong ties severely inhibit information diffusion by confining the spreading process among agents with recurrent communication patterns. This provides the counterintuitive evidence that strong ties may have a negative role in the spreading of information across networks.},

abstract = {We propose a methodology for extracting social network structure from spatio-temporal datasets that describe timestamped occurrences of individuals. Our approach identifies temporal regions of dense agent activity and links are drawn between individuals based on their co-occurrences across these 'gathering events'. The statistical significance of these connections is then tested against an appropriate null model. Such a framework allows us to exploit the wealth of analytical and computational tools of network analysis in settings where the underlying connectivity pattern between interacting agents (commonly termed the adjacency matrix) is not given a priori. We perform experiments on two large-scale datasets (greater than 10(6) points) of great tit Parus major wild bird foraging records and illustrate the use of this approach by examining the temporal dynamics of pairing behaviour, a process that was previously very hard to observe. We show that established pair bonds are maintained continuously, whereas new pair bonds form at variable times before breeding, but are characterized by a rapid development of network proximity. The method proposed here is general, and can be applied to any system with information about the temporal co-occurrence of interacting agents.},

The ensuing individual-based control strategies, however, are difficult to carry out in practice and ignore important correlations between topological and temporal patterns. Here we adopt a mesoscopic perspective and present a principled framework to identify collective features at multiple scales and rank their importance for epidemic spread. We use tensor decomposition techniques to build an additive representation of a temporal network in terms of mesostructures, such as cohesive clusters and temporally-localized mixing patterns. This representation allows to determine the impact of individual mesostructures on epidemic spread and to assess the effect of targeted interventions that remove chosen structures. We illustrate this approach using high-resolution social network data on face-to-face interactions in a school and show that our method affords the design of effective mesoscale interventions.},

abstract = {Biological functions are often realized by groups of interacting molecules or cells. Membership in these groups may overlap when molecules or cells are reused in multiple functions. Traditional clustering methods assign each component to one group. Noisy measurements are common in high-throughput biological datasets. These two limitations reduce our ability to accurately define clusters in biological datasets and to interpret their biological functions. To address these limitations, we designed an algorithm called SpeakEasy, which detects overlapping or non-overlapping communities in biological networks. Input to SpeakEasy can be physical networks, such as molecular interactions, or inferred networks, such as gene coexpression networks. The networks can be directed or undirected, and may contain negative links. SpeakEasy combines traditional bottom-up and top-down approaches to clustering, by creating competition between clusters. Nodes that oscillate between multiple clusters in this competition are classified as multi-community nodes. SpeakEasy can quickly process networks with tens of thousands of nodes, quantify the stability of each cluster and detect an optimal number of clusters without requiring user preset parameter. Clustering networks derived from gene microarrays, protein affinity, sorted cell populations, electrophysiology, functional magnetic resonance imaging of resting-state brain activity, and synthetic datasets validate the ability of SpeakEasy to facilitate biological insights. For instance, we can identify overlapping co-regulated genes sets, multi-complex proteins and robust changes to the community structure of co-active brain regions in Parkinson disease. These insights rely on a robust overlapping clustering approach that enables a more realistic interpretation of common high-throughput datasets.},

In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient overlapping community detection method for very large real-world networks. Taking a high-quality, non-overlapping partition generated by existing, efficient, non-overlapping community detection methods as input, our method identifies overlapping nodes between each pair of connected non-overlapping communities in turn. Through our analysis on modularity, we deduce that, to become an overlapping node without demolishing modularity, nodes should satisfy a specific condition presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm outputs high quality overlapping communities by efficiently identifying overlapping nodes that satisfy the above condition. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks show that in most cases our method is better than other algorithms either in the quality of results or the computational performance. In some cases, our method is the only one that can produce overlapping communities in the very large real-world networks used in the experiments.},

abstract = {The analysis of social networks is a challenging research area, in particular because of their dynamic features. In this paper, we study such evolving graphs through the evolution of their community structure. More specifically, we build on existing approaches for the identification of stable communities over time. This paper presents two contributions.We first propose a new way to compute such stable communities, using a different time scale, called intrinsic time. This intrinsic time is related to the dynamics of the graph (e.g, in terms of link appearance or disappearance) and independent from traditional (extrinsic) time units, like the second. We then show how visualization both at intrinsic and extrinsic time scales can help validating and interpreting the obtained communities. Our results are illustrated on a social network made of contacts among the participants of the 2006 edition of the Infocom conference.},

abstract = {Patterns of deliberate human activity and behavior are of utmost importance in areas as diverse as disease spread, resource allocation, and emergency response. Because of its widespread availability and use, e-mail correspondence provides an attractive proxy for studying human activity. Recently, it was reported that the probability density for the inter-event time tau between consecutively sent e-mails decays asymptotically as tau(-alpha), with alpha approximately 1. The slower-than-exponential decay of the inter-event time distribution suggests that deliberate human activity is inherently non-Poissonian. Here, we demonstrate that the approximate power-law scaling of the inter-event time distribution is a consequence of circadian and weekly cycles of human activity. We propose a cascading nonhomogeneous Poisson process that explicitly integrates these periodic patterns in activity with an individual's tendency to continue participating in an activity. Using standard statistical techniques, we show that our model is consistent with the empirical data. Our findings may also provide insight into the origins of heavy-tailed distributions in other complex systems.},

All other theoretically-fast algorithms for sparse graphs have been shown to be significantly slower than the algorithm of Tomita et al. (Theoretical Computer Science, 2006) in practice. However, the algorithm of Tomita et al. uses an adjacency matrix, which requires too much space for large sparse graphs.

abstract = {Community detection on networks is a well-known problem encountered in many fields, for which the existing algorithms are inefficient 1) at capturing overlaps in-between communities, 2) at detecting communities having disparities in size and density 3) at taking into account the networks' dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm (iLCD) for community detection using a radically new approach. Taking into account the dynamics of the network, it is designed for the detection of strongly overlapping communities. We first explain the main principles underlying the iLCD algorithm, introducing the two notions of intrinsic communities and longitudinal detection, and detail the algorithm. Then, we illustrate its efficiency in the case of a citation network, and then compare it with existing most efficient algorithms using a standard generator of community-based networks, the LFR benchmark.},

In this work we investigate which community finding algorithm most effectively informs this routing task. While early community finding algorithms partitioned networks into flat disjoint communities, more recent methods return community structures that can be overlapping and hierarchical. Given this diversity, it seems reasonable to expect that some methods will be better suited to message routing than others. In this paper, we evaluate a number of community finding strategies and find that Link Clustering, which returns overlapping hierarchical clusters, is very effective. We also find that InfoMap performs well – this is somewhat surprising given that InfoMap returns a flat partition of the network, however this may be because the optimization that drives InfoMap is based on flow.},

Depuis les travaux de Girvan et Newman en 2002, des centaines de travaux ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} men{\'{e}}s sur le sujet, notamment la proposition d'un nombre important d'algorithmes de plus en plus {\'{e}}labor{\'{e}}s. Cependant, la majorit{\'{e}} de ces travaux portent sur des communaut{\'{e}}s statiques dans des r{\'{e}}seaux statiques. Or, beaucoup de r{\'{e}}seaux de terrains sont en fait dynamiques, ils {\'{e}}voluent au cours du temps. L'apport principal de cette th{\`{e}}se est donc la conception d'un algorithme de d{\'{e}}tection de communaut{\'{e}}s dynamiques sur des r{\'{e}}seaux temporels. Le manuscrit est d{\'{e}}coup{\'{e}} en quatre sections : La premi{\`{e}}re est un {\'{e}}tat de l'art, o{\`{u}} sont pass{\'{e}}s en revu les m{\'{e}}thodes existantes pour la d{\'{e}}tection de communaut{\'{e}}, statiques, dynamiques, avec et sans recouvrement.

La troisi{\`{e}}me partie pr{\'{e}}sente les travaux effectu{\'{e}}s pour valider iLCD sur le plan statique, c'est {\`{a}} dire valider que les communaut{\'{e}}s trouv{\'{e}}es sont pertinentes compar{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} d'autres algorithmes existant sur des r{\'{e}}seaux statiques.

Enfin, la derni{\`{e}}re partie est consacr{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} la validation de l'aspect dynamique d'iLCD. En effet, la dynamique introduit des donn{\'{e}}es suppl{\'{e}}mentaires : l'apparition et la disparition de communaut{\'{e}}s, leur {\'{e}}volution en continue, ainsi que des op{\'{e}}rations complexes, telles que la fusion ou la division de communaut{\'{e}}s au cours du temps.

Networks often show a hierarchical organization, with communities embedded within other communities; moreover, nodes can be shared between different communities. Here we present the first algorithm that finds both overlapping communities and the hierarchical structure. The method is based on the local optimization of a fitness function. Community structure is revealed by peaks in the fitness histogram. The resolution can be tuned by a parameter enabling to investigate different hierarchical levels of organization.

We show theoretically that a strong modular structure dampens the importance of burstiness, and empirically that either of the three factors may be dominant in real-life data. These results provide a theoretical framework for the modeling of diffusion on temporal networks representing human interactions, often characterized by non-Poissonian contact patterns.},

abstract = {Although widely used in practice, the behavior and accuracy of the popular module identification technique called modularity maximization is not well understood in practical contexts. Here, we present a broad characterization of its performance in such situations. First, we revisit and clarify the resolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show that the modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an exponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a clear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum modularity Q{\_}max for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it depends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules it contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we show that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not all, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and the distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any modularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in scientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successful at finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics can disagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude by discussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combining information from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.},

abstract = {Understanding the patterns of human dynamics and social interaction and the way they lead to the formation of an organized and functional society are important issues especially for techno-social development. Addressing these issues of social networks has recently become possible through large scale data analysis of mobile phone call records, which has revealed the existence of modular or community structure with many links between nodes of the same community and relatively few links between nodes of different communities. The weights of links, e.g., the number of calls between two users, and the network topology are found correlated such that intra-community links are stronger compared to the weak inter-community links. This feature is known as Granovetter's "The strength of weak ties" hypothesis. In addition to this inhomogeneous community structure, the temporal patterns of human dynamics turn out to be inhomogeneous or bursty, characterized by the heavy tailed distribution of time interval between two consecutive events, i.e., inter-event time. In this paper, we study how the community structure and the bursty dynamics emerge together in a simple evolving weighted network model. The principal mechanisms behind these patterns are social interaction by cyclic closure, i.e., links to friends of friends and the focal closure, links to individuals sharing similar attributes or interests, and human dynamics by task handling process. These three mechanisms have been implemented as a network model with local attachment, global attachment, and priority-based queuing processes. By comprehensive numerical simulations we show that the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the emergence of heavy tailed inter-event time distribution and the evolution of Granovetter-type community structure. Moreover, the numerical results are found to be in qualitative agreement with empirical analysis results from mobile phone call dataset.},

abstract = {To understand the contact patterns of a population -- who is in contact with whom, and when the contacts happen -- is crucial for modeling outbreaks of infectious disease. Traditional theoretical epidemiology assumes that any individual can meet any with equal probability. A more modern approach, network epidemiology, assumes people are connected into a static network over which the disease spreads. Newer yet, temporal network epidemiology, includes the time in the contact representations. In this paper, we investigate the effect of these successive inclusions of more information. Using empirical proximity data, we study both outbreak sizes from unknown sources, and from known states of ongoing outbreaks. In the first case, there are large differences going from a fully mixed simulation to a network, and from a network to a temporal network. In the second case, differences are smaller. We interpret these observations in terms of the temporal network structure of the data sets. For example, a fast overturn of nodes and links seem to make the temporal information more important.},

abstract = {Online consumer behavior in general and online customer engagement with brands in particular, has become a major focus of research activity fuelled by the exponential increase of interactive functions of the internet and social media platforms and applications. Current research in this area is mostly hypothesis-driven and much debate about the concept of Customer Engagement and its related constructs remains existent in the literature. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel methodology for reverse engineering a consumer behavior model for online customer engagement, based on a computational and data-driven perspective. This methodology could be generalized and prove useful for future research in the fields of consumer behaviors using questionnaire data or studies investigating other types of human behaviors. The method we propose contains five main stages; symbolic regression analysis, graph building, community detection, evaluation of results and finally, investigation of directed cycles and common feedback loops. The 'communities' of questionnaire items that emerge from our community detection method form possible 'functional constructs' inferred from data rather than assumed from literature and theory. Our results show consistent partitioning of questionnaire items into such 'functional constructs' suggesting the method proposed here could be adopted as a new data-driven way of human behavior modeling.},

In this study, we identify a problem in the concept of modularity and suggest a solution to overcome this problem. Specifically, we obtain a new quality function for community detection. We refer to the function as Z-modularity because it measures the Z-score of a given division with respect to the fraction of the number of edges within communities. Our theoretical analysis shows that Z-modularity mitigates the resolution limit of the original modularity in certain cases.

abstract = {Identification of communities in complex networks is an important topic and issue in many fields such as sociology, biology, and computer science. Communities are often defined as groups of related nodes or links that correspond to functional subunits in the corresponding complex systems. While most conventional approaches have focused on discovering communities of nodes, some recent studies start partitioning links to find overlapping communities straightforwardly. In this paper, we propose a new quantity function for link community identification in complex networks. Based on this quantity function we formulate the link community partition problem into an integer programming model which allows us to partition a complex network into overlapping communities. We further propose a genetic algorithm for link community detection which can partition a network into overlapping communities without knowing the number of communities. We test our model and algorithm on both artificial networks and real-world networks. The results demonstrate that the model and algorithm are efficient in detecting overlapping community structure in complex networks.},

abstract = {Detecting community structure is fundamental for uncovering the links between structure and function in complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology. A popular method now widely used relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity, which is a quality index for a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection method.},

abstract = {We use a Potts model community detection algorithm to accurately and quantitatively evaluate the hierarchical or multiresolution structure of a graph. Our multiresolution algorithm calculates correlations among multiple copies ("replicas") of the same graph over a range of resolutions. Significant multiresolution structures are identified by strongly correlated replicas. The average normalized mutual information, the variation in information, and other measures, in principle, give a quantitative estimate of the "best" resolutions and indicate the relative strength of the structures in the graph. Because the method is based on information comparisons, it can, in principle, be used with any community detection model that can examine multiple resolutions. Our approach may be extended to other optimization problems. As a local measure, our Potts model avoids the "resolution limit" that affects other popular models. With this model, our community detection algorithm has an accuracy that ranks among the best of currently available methods. Using it, we can examine graphs over 40 x10;{\{}6{\}} nodes and more than 1 x10;{\{}9{\}} edges. We further report that the multiresolution variant of our algorithm can solve systems of at least 200 000 nodes and 10 x 10;{\{}6{\}} edges on a single processor with exceptionally high accuracy. For typical cases, we find a superlinear scaling O(L1.3) for community detection and O(L1.3 log N) for the multiresolution algorithm, where L is the number of edges and N is the number of nodes in the system.},

abstract = {There is an ever-increasing interest in investigating dynamics in time-varying graphs (TVGs). Nevertheless, so far, the notion of centrality in TVG scenarios usually refers to metrics that assess the relative importance of nodes along the temporal evolution of the dynamic complex network. For some TVG scenarios, however, more important than identifying the central nodes under a given node centrality definition is identifying the key time instants for taking certain actions. In this paper, we thus introduce and investigate the notion of time centrality in TVGs. Analogously to node centrality, time centrality evaluates the relative importance of time instants in dynamic complex networks. In this context, we present two time centrality metrics related to diffusion processes. We evaluate the two defined metrics using a real-world dataset representing an in-person contact dynamic network. We validate the concept of time centrality showing that diffusion starting at the best classified time instants (i.e. the most central ones), according to our metrics, can perform a faster and more efficient diffusion process.},

abstract = {Community structure is observed in many real-world networks, such as (online) social networks, where groups of friends of a certain person are often also friends of each other. Newman's modularity has been explored as an important quantitative metric for communities and clusters detection in networks. We present a new expressions and bounds for the modularity. These expressions reveal conditions for or properties of the maximum modularity of a network in both topological and spectral domains. Finding the maximum modularity of a given graph has been proven to be NP-complete and therefore, several heuristic algorithms have been proposed in the past. We investigate the problem of finding the maximum modularity of classes of graphs that have the same number of links and/or nodes and determine analytical upper bounds. Moreover, from the set of all connected graphs with a fixed number of links and/or number of nodes, we construct graphs that can attain maximum modularity, named maximum modular graphs. The maximum modularity is shown to depend on the residue obtained when the number of links is divided by the number of partitions. The modularity depends on the chosen partitioning of the network into communities, which makes finding the specific partition that leads to the maximum modularity a hard problem. In this thesis, we prove that deciding whether a graph with a given number of links, number of communities, and modularity exists is NP-complete and subsequently propose a heuristic algorithm for generating random graphs with a given modularity and number of links with different topological properties. The generator can be used in the broad field of modeling and analyzing clustered social or organizational networks. We also propose a model which can randomly generate simple graphs which are line graphs of other simple graphs, employing an iterative merging procedure. These graphs possess interesting properties, for example, if the cliques are all of the same size, the assortativities of the line graphs in each step are close to 0, and the assortativities of the corresponding root graphs increases linearly from -1 to 0 with the steps of the nodal merging process. Due to their importance to society, communication systems, represented as complex networks, should be built and operated to withstand failures. We define robustness as the maintenance of functionality under node or link removal. In this context, the functionality is measured by several graph metrics. We study the robustness of both static and time-varying networks under node removal, considering random node failure, as well as targeted node attacks based on network centrality measures. In static networks, targeted and random failures have been studied in the literature; however, existing approaches tend to study random failure in terms of average-case behavior, giving no idea of how badly network performance can degrade purely by chance. Instead of considering average network performance under random failure, we compute the network performance probability density functions as functions of the fraction of nodes removed. We show that many centrality measures produce similar targeted attacks in both static and time-varying networks and that a combination of degree centrality and eigenvector centrality may be enough to evaluate worst-case behavior of static networks: even small subsets of highly connected nodes act as a bottleneck in the static or temporal information flow, becoming critical weak points of the entire system. We also study the robustness envelope and targeted attack responses of static networks that are rewired to have high and low degree assortativities, discovering that moderate assortativity increases confer more robustness against targeted attacks whilst moderate decreases confer more robustness against random uniform attacks. In time-varying randomly generated networks, where all the nodes have similar properties, we show that random errors and intelligent attacks exhibit similar behavior. However, cost considerations make network providers less inclined to take robustness measures against failures that are unlikely to manifest, like several failures coinciding simultaneously. Considering networks embedded in a two-dimensional plane, we study the problem of finding a critical region - a part of the network that can be enclosed by a given elementary figure of predetermined size - whose destruction would lead to the highest network disruption. We determine that the problem is polynomially solvable and propose appropriate algorithms. In addition, we consider region-aware network augmentation to decrease the impact of a regional failure. We subsequently address the region-disjoint paths problem, which asks for two paths with minimum total weight between a source and a destination that cannot both be cut by a single regional failure of a given diameter (unless that failure includes the source and the destination). We prove that deciding whether region-disjoint paths exist is NP-hard and propose a heuristic region-disjoint paths algorithm. Defining an optimal protection strategy against viruses, spam propagation or any other kind of contamination process is an important feature for designing new networks and architectures. The first approach is a network adaptation, which is the interplay between disease dynamics on a network and the topology dynamics. A continuous-time adaptive Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (ASIS) model is introduced in order to investigate this interaction, where a susceptible node avoids infections by breaking its links to its infected neighbors while it enhances the connections with other susceptible nodes by creating links to them. When the initial topology of the network is a complete graph, an exact solution to the average metastable state fraction of infected nodes is derived without resorting to any mean-field approximation. A linear scaling law of the epidemic threshold as a function of the effective link-breaking rate is found. The metastable state topology shows high connectivity and low modularity in two cases: (i) a ``strongly adaptive'' region with very high effective spreading rate, and (ii) a ``weakly adaptive'' region with very low effective spreading rate. These two regions are separated from the other half-open elliptical-like regions of low connectivity and high modularity in a contour-line-like way. Our results indicate that the adaptation of the topology in response to disease dynamics suppresses the infection, while it promotes the network evolution towards a topology that exhibits assortative-mixing, modular structure and a binomial-like degree distribution. In the second approach, we consider decentralized optimal protection strategies when a virus is propagating over a network through a SIS epidemic process. By assuming that each node in the network can decide to protect itself from infection at a constant cost, we model our system using a game theoretic framework. We find pure, mixed equilibria, and the Price of Anarchy (PoA) in several network topologies and propose algorithms to compute a pure equilibrium.},

Here we propose a generalized formalism for linear dynamics on complex networks, able to incorporate statistical properties of the timings at which events occur. We show that the diffusion dynamics is affected by the network community structure and by the temporal properties of waiting times between events. We identify the main mechanism-network structure, burstiness or fat tails of waiting times-determining the relaxation times of stochastic processes on temporal networks, in the absence of temporal-structure correlations. We identify situations when fine-scale structure can be discarded from the description of the dynamics or, conversely, when a fully detailed model is required due to temporal heterogeneities.},

abstract = {To comprehend the hierarchical organization of large integrated systems, we introduce the hierarchical map equation, which reveals multilevel structures in networks. In this information-theoretic approach, we exploit the duality between compression and pattern detection; by compressing a description of a random walker as a proxy for real flow on a network, we find regularities in the network that induce this system-wide flow. Finding the shortest multilevel description of the random walker therefore gives us the best hierarchical clustering of the network--the optimal number of levels and modular partition at each level--with respect to the dynamics on the network. With a novel search algorithm, we extract and illustrate the rich multilevel organization of several large social and biological networks. For example, from the global air traffic network we uncover countries and continents, and from the pattern of scientific communication we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in four major disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth sciences, and social sciences. In general, we find shallow hierarchical structures in globally interconnected systems, such as neural networks, and rich multilevel organizations in systems with highly separated regions, such as road networks.},

abstract = {Temporal communities are the result of a consistent partitioning of nodes across multiple snapshots of an evolving network, and they provide insights into how dense clusters in a network emerge, combine, split and decay over time. To reliably detect temporal communities we need to not only find a good community partition in a given snapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s) found in the previous snapshot(s), a particularly difficult task given the extreme sensitivity of community structure yielded by current methods to changes in the network structure. Here, motivated by the inertia of inter-node relationships, we present a new measure of partition distance called estrangement, and show that constraining estrangement enables one to find meaningful temporal communities at various degrees of temporal smoothness in diverse real-world datasets. Estrangement confinement thus provides a principled approach to uncovering temporal communities in evolving networks.},

abstract = {Community detection in complex networks is a fundamental data analysis task in various domains, and how to effectively find overlapping communities in real applications is still a challenge. In this work, we propose a new unified model and method for finding the best overlapping communities on the basis of the associated node and link partitions derived from the same framework. Specifically, we first describe a unified model that accommodates node and link communities (partitions) together, and then present a nonnegative matrix factorization method to learn the parameters of the model. Thereafter, we infer the overlapping communities based on the derived node and link communities, i.e., determine each overlapped community between the corresponding node and link community with a greedy optimization of a local community function conductance. Finally, we introduce a model selection method based on consensus clustering to determine the number of communities. We have evaluated our method on both synthetic and real-world networks with ground-truths, and compared it with seven state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the competing ones in detecting overlapping communities for all analysed data sets. Improved performance is particularly pronounced in cases of more complicated networked community structures.},

abstract = {Online community detection is essential for social network analysis. Modularity is a quality function used to measure the strength of the community structure discovered with social networks. Existing methods detect community structures through modularity analysis. However, the existing modularities are unable to identify community structures correctly when communities are very different in size, in particular, when the size of some communities is very small compared with others. To address this problem, we propose the concept of a coupling coefficient between two communities and define a new modularity, MC modularity, to evaluate the quality of the discovered community structures. This method can provide adequate measures for the quality of community structures. In addition, we develop the DC{\_}MC algorithm to detect community structures based on the concept of MC modularity. An algorithm for shifting a group of nodes, instead of one node at a time, amongst communities also is designed to achieve optimal results. The effectiveness and efficacy of the approach we proposed have been demonstrated through a set of experiments involving real data benchmarks and synthetic data sets that are purpose-built for evaluating different types of networks.},

abstract = {The epidemic threshold of a spreading process indicates the condition for the occurrence of the wide spreading regime, thus representing a predictor of the network vulnerability to the epidemic. Such threshold depends on the natural history of the disease and on the pattern of contacts of the network with its time variation. Based on the theoretical framework introduced in (Valdano et al. PRX 2015) for a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model, we formulate here an infection propagator approach to compute the epidemic threshold accounting for more realistic effects regarding a varying force of infection per contact, the presence of immunity, and a limited time resolution of the temporal network. We apply the approach to two temporal network models and an empirical dataset of school contacts. We find that permanent or temporary immunity do not affect the estimation of the epidemic threshold through the infection propagator approach. Comparisons with numerical results show the good agreement of the analytical predictions. Aggregating the temporal network rapidly deteriorates the predictions, except for slow diseases once the heterogeneity of the links is preserved. Weight-topology correlations are found to be the critical factor to be preserved to improve accuracy in the prediction.},

We then apply a selection of community detection algorithms, designed to process only positive links, to these data. We also apply Parallel Iterative Local Search (Parallel ILS), an algorithm recently proposed to identify balanced partitions in signed networks. Our results show that, contrary to the conclusions of a previous study focusing on other data, the partitions detected by ignoring or considering the negative links are indeed remarkably different for these networks. The relevance of negative links for graph partitioning therefore is an open question which should be further explored.},

abstract = {A diverse variety of processes — including recurrent disease episodes, neuron firing, and commu-nication patterns among humans — can be described using inter-event time (IET) distributions. Many such processes are ongoing, although event sequences are only available during a finite ob-servation window. Because the observation time window is more likely to begin or end during long IETs than during short ones, the analysis of such data is susceptible to a bias induced by the finite observation period. In this paper, we illustrate how this length bias is born and how it can be cor-rected. To do this, we model event sequences using stationary renewal processes, and we formulate simple heuristics for determining the severity of the bias. To illustrate our results, we focus on the example of empirical communication networks, which are temporal networks that are constructed from communication events. The IET distributions of such systems guide efforts to build models of human behavior, and the variance of IETs is very important for estimating the spreading rate of information in networks of temporal interactions. It is thus crucial to have good estimates for the statistics of IET tails. We analyze several well-known data sets from the literature, and we find that the vast majority of event sequences of these data sets are susceptible to finite window-size effects. We demonstrate that the resulting bias can lead to systematic underestimates of the variance in the IET distributions and that correcting for the bias can lead to qualitatively different results for the tails of the IET distributions — and this is especially true for IETs with heavy-tails, which are often of interest.},

abstract = {In this paper, an incremental density-based clustering algorithm IncOrder is proposed for detecting communities in dynamic networks. It consists of two separate stages: an online stage and an offline stage. The online stage maintains the traversal sequence of a network and the offline stage extracts communities from the sequence. Based on a symmetric measure core-connectivity-similarity between pairs of adjacent nodes, the online stage builds an index structure, called core-connected chain, for dynamic networks. Since the slight change of a network has a very limited impact on its cluster chain, the chain of a dynamic network can be efficiently preserved. The offline stage extracts all possible density-based clustering results for all similarity thresholds from the chain. By maximizing a modularity function, the proposed method can automatically select the parameter of similarity threshold. Experimental results on a large number of real-world and synthetic networks show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract = {Spreading on networks is influenced by a number of factors, including different parts of the inter-event time distribution (IETD), the topology of the network and non-stationarity. In order to understand the role of these factors we study the SI model on temporal networks with different aggregated topologies and different IETDs. Based on analytic calculations and numerical simulations, we show that if the stationary bursty process is governed by power-law IETD, the spreading can be slowed down or accelerated as compared to a Poisson process; the speed is determined by the short time behaviour, which in our model is controlled by the exponent. We demonstrate that finite, so called ?locally tree-like? networks, like the Barab?si?Albert networks behave very differently from real tree graphs if the IETD is strongly fat-tailed, as the lack or presence of rare alternative paths modifies the spreading. A further important result is that the non-stationarity of the dynamics has a significant effect on the spreading speed for strongly fat-tailed power-law IETDs, thus bursty processes characterized by small power-law exponents can cause slow spreading in the stationary state but also very rapid spreading, with this heavily dependent on the age of the processes.},

Despite the large variety of methods proposed to detect communities in graphs, there is a big need for multi-purpose techniques, able to handle different types of datasets and the subtleties of community structure. In this paper we present OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization Method), the first method capable to detect clusters in networks accounting for edge directions, edge weights, overlapping communities, hierarchies and community dynamics. It is based on the local optimization of a fitness function expressing the statistical significance of clusters with respect to random fluctuations, which is estimated with tools of Extreme and Order Statistics. OSLOM can be used alone or as a refinement procedure of partitions/covers delivered by other techniques. We have also implemented sequential algorithms combining OSLOM with other fast techniques, so that the community structure of very large networks can be uncovered. Our method has a comparable performance as the best existing algorithms on artificial benchmark graphs. Several applications on real networks are shown as well. OSLOM is implemented in a freely available software (http://www.oslom.org), and we believe it will be a valuable tool in the analysis of networks.},

abstract = {In the last decade, structural properties of several natu- rally arising networks (the Internet, social networks, the web graph, etc.) have been studied intensively with a view to understanding their evolution. In recent empirical work, Leskovec, Kleinberg, and Faloutsos identify two new and surprising properties of the evolution of many real-world net- works: densification (the ratio of edges to vertices grows over time), and shrinking diameter (the diameter reduces over time to a constant). These properties run counter to con- ventional wisdom, and are certainly inconsistent with graph models prior to their work. In this paper, we present the first model that provides a simple, realistic, and mathematically tractable generative model that intrinsically explains all the well-known pro- perties of the social networks, as well as densification and shrinking diameter. Our model is based on ideas studied empirically in the social sciences, primarily on the ground- breaking work of Breiger (1973) on bipartite models of social networks that capture the affiliation of agents to societies. We also present algorithms that harness the structural consequences of our model. Specifically, we show how to overcome the bottleneck of densification in computing short- est paths between vertices by producing sparse subgraphs that preserve or approximate shortest distances to all or a distinguished subset of vertices. This is a rare example of an algorithmic benefit derived from a realistic graph model. Finally, our work also presents a modular approach to con- necting random graph paradigms (preferential attachment, edge-copying, etc.) to structural consequences (heavy-tailed degree distributions, shrinking diameter, etc.).},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop the idea to partition the edges of a weighted graph in order to uncover overlapping communities of its nodes. Our approach is based on the construction of different types of weighted line graphs, i.e. graphs whose nodes are the links of the original graph, that encapsulate differently the relations between the edges. Weighted line graphs are argued to provide an alternative, valuable representation of the system's topology, and are shown to have important applications in community detection, as the usual node partition of a line graph naturally leads to an edge partition of the original graph. This identification allows us to use traditional partitioning methods in order to address the long-standing problem of the detection of overlapping communities. We apply it to the analysis of different social and geographical networks.},

In order to provide evaluation of graph clustering quality, many different indices have been proposed in previous work. Indices are used to compare different graph partitions but also different clustering techniques. Moreover, some clustering techniques are based on index optimization. Indices can also be added as visual tips in graph layouts. Despite the importance of the subject, little has been done to unify the field. It results that many indices can not be easily compared or interpreted. In this paper, we provide a unified and synthetic view of indices used in graph clustering area and discuss them.

abstract = {We propose a novel model for representing finite discrete Time-Varying Graphs{\~{}}(TVGs). We show how key concepts, such as degree, path, and connectivity, are handled in our model. We also analyze the data structures built following our proposed model and demonstrate that, for most practical cases, the asymptotic memory complexity of our model is restricted to the cardinality of the set of edges. Moreover, we prove that if the TVG nodes can be considered as independent entities at each time instant, the analyzed TVG is isomorphic to a directed static graph. This is an important theoretical result since this allows the use of the isomorphic directed graph as a tool to analyze both the properties of a TVG and the behavior of dynamic processes over a TVG. We also show that our unifying model can represent several previous (classes of) models for dynamic networks found in the recent literature, which in general are unable to represent each other. In contrast to previous models, our proposal is also able to intrinsically model cyclic{\~{}}(i.e. periodic) behavior in dynamic networks. These representation capabilities attest the expressive power of our proposed unifying model for TVGs.},

abstract = {The past few years have seen intensive research efforts carried out in some apparently unrelated areas of dynamic systems -- delay-tolerant networks, opportunistic-mobility networks, social networks -- obtaining closely related insights. Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed as parts of the same conceptual universe; and the formal models proposed so far to express some specific concepts are components of a larger formal description of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on whether the indicators for these properties are a-temporal (as in the majority of existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction of randomness in TVGs.},

Community detection is a good way to understand the structure, function and evolution of complex networks. There have been some methods to find disjoint or overlapping communities. While most of these methods only fit one single situation, disjoint or overlapping. In our opinion, it is unreasonable to find disjoint communities on a network with clear overlap or to find overlapping communities on a network without any visible overlapping node. In this paper, we propose a link partition based method which can find communities with adjustable extent of overlapping according to backgrounds of specific applications or personal preferences. Experimental results on some real-world networks show that our method can find reasonable communities with adjustable extent of overlapping, and is suitable for networks with high densities and large scales.},

abstract = {Networks are a convenient way to represent complex systems of interacting entities. Many networks contain "communities" of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to nodes in the rest of the network. In this paper, we investigate the detection of communities in temporal networks represented as multilayer networks. As a focal example, we study time-dependent financial-asset correlation networks. We first argue that the use of the "modularity" quality function---which is defined by comparing edge weights in an observed network to expected edge weights in a "null network"---is application-dependent. We differentiate between "null networks" and "null models" in our discussion of modularity maximization, and we highlight that the same null network can correspond to different null models. We then investigate a multilayer modularity-maximization problem to identify communities in temporal networks. Our multilayer analysis only depends on the form of the maximization problem and not on the specific quality function that one chooses. We introduce a diagnostic to measure $\backslash$emph{\{}persistence{\}} of community structure in a multilayer network partition. We prove several results that describe how the multilayer maximization problem measures a trade-off between static community structure within layers and higher values of persistence across layers. We also discuss some implementation issues that the popular "Louvain" heuristic faces with temporal multilayer networks and suggest ways to mitigate them.},

In this work, we introduce OClustR, a new graph-based clustering algorithm for building overlapping clusters. The proposed algorithm introduces a new graph-covering strategy and a new filtering strategy, which together allow to build overlapping clusterings more accurately than those built by previous algorithms. The experimental evaluation, conducted over several standard collections, showed that our proposed algorithm builds less clusters than those built by the previous related algorithms. Additionally, OClustR builds clusters with overlapping closer to the real overlapping in the collections than the overlapping generated by other clustering algorithms.},

abstract = {In a temporal network, the presence and activity of nodes and links can change through time. To describe temporal networks we introduce the notion of temporal quantities. We define the addition and multiplication of temporal quantities in a way that can be used for the definition of addition and multiplication of temporal networks. The corresponding algebraic structures are semirings. The usual approach to (data) analysis of temporal networks is to transform it into a sequence of time slices -- static networks corresponding to selected time intervals and analyze each of them using standard methods to produce a sequence of results. The approach proposed in this paper enables us to compute these results directly. We developed fast algorithms for the proposed operations. They are available as an open source Python library TQ (Temporal Quantities) and a program Ianus. The proposed approach enables us to treat as temporal quantities also other network characteristics such as degrees, connectivity components, centrality measures, Pathfinder skeleton, etc. To illustrate the developed tools we present some results from the analysis of Franzosi's violence network and Corman's Reuters terror news network.},

These communities are inherent characteristics of human interaction in online social networks, as well as paper citation networks. Also, communities may evolve over time, due to changes to individuals' roles and social status in the network as well as changes to individuals' research interests. We present an innovative algorithm that deviates from the traditional two-step approach to analyze community evolutions. In the traditional approach, communities are first detected for each time slice, and then compared to determine correspondences. We argue that this approach is inappropriate in applications with noisy data. In this paper, we propose FacetNet for analyzing communities and their evolutions through a robust unified process. This novel framework will discover communities and capture their evolution with temporal smoothness given by historic community structures. Our approach relies on formulating the problem in terms of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, where the community structure is estimated both by the observed networked data and by the prior distribution given by historic community structures. Then we develop an iterative algorithm, with proven low time complexity, which is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. We perform extensive experimental studies, on both synthetic datasets and real datasets, to demonstrate that our method discovers meaningful communities and provides additional insights not directly obtainable from traditional methods.},

The algorithms available in the literature mainly follow two strategies, one, which allows a node to be a part of multiple communities with equal membership, and the second considers a disjoint partition of the whole network where a node belongs to only one community. In this paper, we proposed a novel community detection algorithm which identifies fuzzy-rough communities where a node can be a part of many groups with different memberships of their association. The algorithm runs on a new framework of social network representation based on fuzzy granular theory. A new index viz. normalized fuzzy mutual information, to quantify the goodness of detected communities is used. Experimental results on benchmark data show the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to other well known methods, particularly when the network contains overlapping communities.},

abstract = {For many networks of scientific interest we know both the connections of the network and information about the network nodes, such as the age or gender of individuals in a social network, geographic location of nodes in the Internet, or cellular function of nodes in a gene regulatory network. Here we demonstrate how this "metadata" can be used to improve our analysis and understanding of network structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detection in networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that combines a network and its metadata to detect communities more accurately than can be done with either alone. Crucially, the method does not assume that the metadata are correlated with the communities we are trying to find. Instead the method learns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether they contain useful information. The learned correlations are also of interest in their own right, allowing us to make predictions about the community membership of nodes whose network connections are unknown. We demonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure and on real-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological, and technological domains.},

abstract = {The traditional semantic social network (SSN) community detection algorithms need to preset the number of the communities and couldn't detect the overlapping communities. To solve the issue of presetting the number of communities, we present a clustering algorithm for community detection based on the link-field-topic (LFT) model suggested. For the process of clustering is independent of context sampling, the number of communities is not necessary to be preset. To solve the issue of overlapping community detection, we establish the semantic link weight (SLW) depending on the analysis of LFT, to evaluate the semantic weight of links for each sampling field. The proposed clustering algorithm is based on the SLW which could separate the SSN into clustering units. As a result, the intersection on several units is the overlapping part. Finally, we establish semantic modularity (SQ) involving SQ1 and SQ2 for the evaluation of the detected semantic communities. The efficiency and feasibility of the LFT model and the semantic modularity is verified by experimental analysis.},

abstract = {Starting from a general ansatz, we show how community detection can be interpreted as finding the ground state of an infinite range spin glass. Our approach applies to weighted and directed networks alike. It contains the ad hoc introduced quality function from [J. Reichardt and S. Bornholdt, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 218701 (2004)] and the modularity Q as defined by Newman and Girvan [Phys. Rev. E 69, 026113 (2004)] as special cases. The community structure of the network is interpreted as the spin configuration that minimizes the energy of the spin glass with the spin states being the community indices. We elucidate the properties of the ground state configuration to give a concise definition of communities as cohesive subgroups in networks that is adaptive to the specific class of network under study. Further, we show how hierarchies and overlap in the community structure can be detected. Computationally efficient local update rules for optimization procedures to find the ground state are given. We show how the ansatz may be used to discover the community around a given node without detecting all communities in the full network and we give benchmarks for the performance of this extension. Finally, we give expectation values for the modularity of random graphs, which can be used in the assessment of statistical significance of community structure.},

abstract = {In complex network research clique percolation, introduced by Palla, Der{\'{e}}nyi, and Vicsek [Nature (London) 435, 814 (2005)], is a deterministic community detection method which allows for overlapping communities and is purely based on local topological properties of a network. Here we present a sequential clique percolation algorithm (SCP) to do fast community detection in weighted and unweighted networks, for cliques of a chosen size. This method is based on sequentially inserting the constituent links to the network and simultaneously keeping track of the emerging community structure. Unlike existing algorithms, the SCP method allows for detecting k -clique communities at multiple weight thresholds in a single run, and can simultaneously produce a dendrogram representation of hierarchical community structure. In sparse weighted networks, the SCP algorithm can also be used for implementing the weighted clique percolation method recently introduced by Farkas [New J. Phys. 9, 180 (2007)]. The computational time of the SCP algorithm scales linearly with the number of k -cliques in the network. As an example, the method is applied to a product association network, revealing its nested community structure.},

abstract = {The possibility to analyze everyday monetary transactions is limited by the scarcity of available data, as this kind of information is usually considered highly sensitive. Present econophysics models are usually employed on presumed random networks of interacting agents, and only some macroscopic properties (e.g. the resulting wealth distribution) are compared to real-world data. In this paper, we analyze Bitcoin, which is a novel digital currency system, where the complete list of transactions is publicly available. Using this dataset, we reconstruct the network of transactions and extract the time and amount of each payment. We analyze the structure of the transaction network by measuring network characteristics over time, such as the degree distribution, degree correlations and clustering. We find that linear preferential attachment drives the growth of the network. We also study the dynamics taking place on the transaction network, i.e. the flow of money. We measure temporal patterns and the wealth accumulation. Investigating the microscopic statistics of money movement, we find that sublinear preferential attachment governs the evolution of the wealth distribution. We report a scaling law between the degree and wealth associated to individual nodes.},

abstract = {Contacts between individuals serve as pathways where infections may propagate. These contact patterns can be represented by network structures. Static structures have been the common modeling paradigm but recent results suggest that temporal structures play different roles to regulate the spread of infections or infection-like dynamics. On temporal networks a vertex is active only at certain moments and inactive otherwise such that a contact is not continuously available. In several empirical networks, the time between two consecutive vertex-activation events typically follows heterogeneous activity (e.g. bursts). In this chapter, we present a simple and intuitive stochastic model of a temporal network and investigate how epidemics co-evolves with the temporal structures, focusing on the growth dynamics of the epidemics. The model assumes no underlying topological structure and is only constrained by the time between two consecutive events of vertex activation. The main observation is that the speed of the infection spread is different in case of heterogeneous and homogeneous temporal patterns but the differences depend on the stage of the epidemics. In comparison to the homogeneous scenario, the power law case results in a faster growth in the beginning but turns out to be slower after a certain time, taking several time steps to reach the whole network.},

abstract = {Nodes in real-world networks are repeatedly observed to form dense clusters, often referred to as communities. Methods to detect these groups of nodes usually maximize an objective function, which implicitly contains the definition of a community. We here analyze a recently proposed measure called Surprise, which assesses the quality of the partition of a network into communities. Given that, in its current form, its formulation is rather difficult to analyze, we develop an accurate asymptotic approximation. This allows for the development of an efficient algorithm for optimizing Surprise. Incidentally, this leads to a straightforward extension of Surprise to weighted graphs. Finally, we analytically compare it to previous methods, which makes clear that Surprise is more discriminative than ER Modularity. Furthermore, we show that it is especially suited for detecting relatively small communities in large graphs, an area where some earlier methods fail.},

abstract = {The problem of comparing two different partitions of a finite set of objects reappears continually in the clustering literature. We begin by review- ing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Milligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from cOrrespond- ing partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addi- tion to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between -4-I},

abstract = {Some temporal networks, most notably citation networks, are naturally represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). To detect communities in DAGs, we propose a modularity for DAGs by defining an appropriate null model (i.e., randomized network) respecting the order of nodes. We implement a spectral method to approximately maximize the proposed modularity measure and test the method on citation networks and other DAGs. We find that the attained values of the modularity for DAGs are similar for partitions that we obtain by maximizing the proposed modularity (designed for DAGs), the modularity for undirected networks and that for general directed networks. In other words, if we neglect the order imposed on nodes (and the direction of links) in a given DAG and maximize the conventional modularity measure, the obtained partition is close to the optimal one in the sense of the modularity for DAGs.},

abstract = {Many real networks that are inferred or collected from data are incomplete due to missing edges. Missing edges can be inherent to the dataset (Facebook friend links will never be complete) or the result of sampling (one may only have access to a portion of the data). The consequence is that downstream analyses that consume the network will often yield less accurate results than if the edges were complete. Community detection algorithms, in particular, often suffer when critical intra-community edges are missing. We propose a novel consensus clustering algorithm to enhance community detection on incomplete networks. Our framework utilizes existing community detection algorithms that process networks imputed by our link prediction based algorithm. The framework then merges their multiple outputs into a final consensus output. On average our method boosts performance of existing algorithms by 7{\%} on artificial data and 17{\%} on ego networks collected from Facebook.},

abstract = {Modularity maximization is the most popular technique for the detection of community structure in graphs. The resolution limit of the method is supposedly solvable with the introduction of modified versions of the measure, with tunable resolution parameters. We show that multiresolution modularity suffers from two opposite coexisting problems: the tendency to merge small subgraphs, which dominates when the resolution is low; the tendency to split large subgraphs, which dominates when the resolution is high. In benchmark networks with heterogeneous distributions of cluster sizes, the simultaneous elimination of both biases is not possible and multiresolution modularity is not capable to recover the planted community structure, not even when it is pronounced and easily detectable by other methods, for any value of the resolution parameter. This holds for other multiresolution techniques and it is likely to be a general problem of methods based on global optimization.},

abstract = {We investigate the communication sequences of millions of people through two different channels and analyse the fine grained temporal structure of correlated event trains induced by single individuals. By focusing on correlations between the heterogeneous dynamics and the topology of egocentric networks we find that the bursty trains usually evolve for pairs of individuals rather than for the ego and his/her several neighbours, thus burstiness is a property of the links rather than of the nodes. We compare the directional balance of calls and short messages within bursty trains to the average on the actual link and show that for the trains of voice calls the imbalance is significantly enhanced, while for short messages the balance within the trains increases. These effects can be partly traced back to the technological constraints (for short messages) and partly to the human behavioural features (voice calls). We define a model that is able to reproduce the empirical results and may help us to understand better the mechanisms driving technology mediated human communication dynamics.},

We focus on the elementary random walk, and put forth a simple mathematical framework that well describes the behavior observed on real datasets.

abstract = {Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. To understand complex networks, it is crucial to investigate their community structure. In this paper, we develop an online community detection algorithm with linear time complexity for large complex networks. Our algorithm processes a network edge by edge in the order that the network is fed to the algorithm. If a new edge is added, it just updates the existing community structure in constant time, and does not need to re-compute the whole network. Therefore, it can efficiently process large networks in real time. Our algorithm optimizes expected modularity instead of modularity at each step to avoid poor performance. The experiments are carried out using 11 public data sets, and are measured by two criteria, modularity and NMI (Normalized Mutual Information). The results show that our algorithm's running time is less than the commonly used Louvain algorithm while it gives competitive performance.},

abstract = {A K -partition of a set S is a splitting of S into K non-overlapping classes that cover all elements of S . Numerous practical applications dealing with data partitioning or clustering require computing the distance between two partitions. Previous articles proved that one can compute it in polynomial time—minimum O ( | S | + K 2 ) and maximum O ( | S | + K 3 ) —using a reduction to the linear assignment problem. We propose several conditions for which the partition distance can be computed in O ( | S | ) time. In practical terms, this computation can be done in O ( | S | ) time for any two relatively resembling partitions (i.e. with distance less than | S | 5 ) except specially constructed cases. Finally, we prove that, even if there is a bounded number of classes for which the proposed conditions are not satisfied, one can still preserve the linear complexity by exploiting decomposition properties of the similarity matrix.},

The number of communities is automatically inferred in a nonparametric Bayesian manner, and efficient inference via Gibbs sampling is derived using novel data augmentation techniques.

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

We test the theoretical predictions on a toy example and on numerical data, and discuss their implications for network theory, in particular in the case of temporal or multiplex networks.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

@article{Ahn2010a,
abstract = {Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein–protein interaction and metabolic networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.},

abstract = {Automatic discovery of community structures in complex networks is a fundamental task in many disciplines, including physics, biology, and the social sciences. The most used criterion for characterizing the existence of a community structure in a network is modularity, a quantitative measure proposed by Newman and Girvan (2004). The discovery community can be formulated as the so-called modularity maximization problem that consists of finding a partition of nodes of a network with the highest modularity. In this letter, we propose a fast and scalable algorithm called DCAM, based on DC (difference of convex function) programming and DCA (DC algorithms), an innovative approach in nonconvex programming framework for solving the modularity maximization problem. The special structure of the problem considered here has been well exploited to get an inexpensive DCA scheme that requires only a matrix-vector product at each iteration. Starting with a very large number of communities, DCAM furnishes, as output results, an optimal partition together with the optimal number of communities c(*); that is, the number of communities is discovered automatically during DCAM's iterations. Numerical experiments are performed on a variety of real-world network data sets with up to 4,194,304 nodes and 30,359,198 edges. The comparative results with height reference algorithms show that the proposed approach outperforms them not only on quality and rapidity but also on scalability. Moreover, it realizes a very good trade-off between the quality of solutions and the run time.},

Here we describe a model for tracking the progress of communities over time in a dynamic network, where each community is characterised by a series of significant evolutionary events. This model is used to motivate a community-matching strategy for efficiently identifying and tracking dynamic communities. Evaluations on synthetic graphs containing embedded events demonstrate that this strategy can successfully track communities over time in volatile networks.

abstract = {Networks provide a powerful mathematical framework for analyzing the structure and dynamics of complex systems (1-3). The study of group behavior has deep roots in the social science literature (4,5) and community detection is a central part of modern network science. Network communities have been found to be highly overlapping and organized in a hierarchical structure (6-9). Recent technological advances have provided a toolset for measuring the detailed social dynamics at scale (10,11). In spite of great progress, a quantitative description of the complex temporal behavior of social groups-with dynamics spanning from minute-by-minute changes to patterns expressed on the timescale of years-is still absent. Here we uncover a class of fundamental structures embedded within highly dynamic social networks. On the shortest time-scale, we find that social gatherings are fluid, with members coming and going, but organized via a stable core of individuals. We show that cores represent social contexts (9), with recurring meetings across weeks and months, each with varying degrees of regularity. In this sense, cores provide a vocabulary which quantifies the patterns of social life. The simplification is so powerful that participation in social contexts is predictable with high precision. Our results offer new perspectives for modeling and understanding of processes in social systems, with applications including epidemiology, social contagion, urban planning, digital economy, and quantitative sociology},

Here we propose a temporal network model which builds on the framework of activity-driven time-varying networks with memory. The model also integrates key mechanisms that drive the formation of social ties - social reinforcement, focal closure and cyclic closure, which have been shown to give rise to community structure and the global connectedness of the network. We compare the proposed model with a real-world time-varying network of mobile phone communication and show that they share several characteristics from heterogeneous degrees and weights to rich community structure. Further, the strong and weak ties that emerge from the model follow similar weight-topology correlations as real-world social networks, including the role of weak ties.},

abstract = {It is a classic topic of social network analysis to evaluate the importance of nodes and identify the node that takes on the role of core or bridge in a network. Because a single indicator is not sufficient to analyze multiple characteristics of a node, it is a natural solution to apply multiple indicators that should be selected carefully. An intuitive idea is to select some indicators with weak correlations to efficiently assess different characteristics of a node. However, this paper shows that it is much better to select the indicators with strong correlations. Because indicator correlation is based on the statistical analysis of a large number of nodes, the particularity of an important node will be outlined if its indicator relationship doesn't comply with the statistical correlation. Therefore, the paper selects the multiple indicators including degree, ego-betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality to evaluate the importance and the role of a node. The importance of a node is equal to the normalized sum of its three indicators. A candidate for core or bridge is selected from the great degree nodes or the nodes with great ego-betweenness centrality respectively. Then, the role of a candidate is determined according to the difference between its indicators' relationship with the statistical correlation of the overall network. Based on 18 real networks and 3 kinds of model networks, the experimental results show that the proposed methods perform quite well in evaluating the importance of nodes and in identifying the node role.},

abstract = {Networks are an important tool for describing and quantifying data on interactions among objects or people, e.g., online social networks, offline friendship networks, and object-user interaction networks, among others. When interactions are dynamic, their evolving pattern can be represented as a sequence of networks each giving the interactions among a common set of vertices at consecutive points in time. An important task in analyzing such evolving networks, and for predicting their future evolution, is change-point detection, in which we identify moments in time across which the large-scale pattern of interactions changes fundamentally. Here, we formalize the network change point detection problem within a probabilistic framework and introduce a method that can reliably solve it in data. This method combines a generalized hierarchical random graph model with a generalized likelihood ratio test to quantitatively determine if, when, and precisely how a change point has occurred. Using synthetic data with known structure, we characterize the difficulty of detecting change points of different types, e.g., groups merging, splitting, forming or fragmenting, and show that this method is more accurate than several alternatives. Applied to two high-resolution evolving social networks, this method identifies a sequence of change points that align with known external shocks to these networks.},

abstract = {Most clustering algorithms organize a collection of objects into a set of disjoint clusters. Although this approach has been successfully applied in unsupervised learning, there are several applications where objects could belong to more than one cluster. Overlapping clustering is an alternative in those contexts like social network analysis, information retrieval and bioinformatics, among other problems where non-disjoint clusters appear. In addition, there are environments where the collection changes frequently and the clustering must be updated; however, most of the existing overlapping clustering algorithms are not able to efficiently update the clustering. In this paper, we introduce a new overlapping clustering algorithm, called DClustR, which is based on the graph theory approach and it introduces a new strategy for building more accurate overlapping clusters than those built by state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm introduces a new strategy for efficiently updating the clustering when the collection changes. The experimentation conducted over several standard collections shows the good performance of the proposed algorithm, wrt. accuracy and efficiency.},

Here, we explore statistical properties and deterministic inference in a model that combines a stochastic block model (SBM) for its static part with independent Markov chains for the evolution of the nodes groups through time. We model binary data as well as weighted dynamic random graphs (with discrete or continuous edges values). Our approach particularly focuses on the control for label switching issues across the different time steps. We study identifiability of the model parameters, propose an inference procedure based on a variational expectation maximization algorithm as well as a model selection criterion to select for the number of groups. We carefully discuss our initialization strategy which plays an important role in the method and compare our procedure with existing ones on synthetic datasets. We also illustrate our approach on a real data set of encounters among high school students and provide an implementation of the method into a R package called dynsbm.},

abstract = {Threshold models try to explain the consequences of social influence like the spread of fads and opinions. Along with models of epidemics, they constitute a major theoretical framework of social spreading processes. In threshold models on static networks, an individual changes her state if a certain fraction of her neighbors has done the same. When there are strong correlations in the temporal aspects of contact patterns, it is useful to represent the system as a temporal network. In such a system, not only contacts but also the time of the contacts are represented explicitly. In many cases, bursty temporal patterns slow down disease spreading. However, as we will see, this is not a universal truth for threshold models. In this work we propose an extension of Watts's classic threshold model to temporal networks. We do this by assuming that an agent is influenced by contacts which lie a certain time into the past. I.e., the individuals are affected by contacts within a time window. In addition to thresholds in the fraction of contacts, we also investigate the number of contacts within the time window as a basis for influence. To elucidate the model's behavior, we run the model on real and randomized empirical contact datasets.},

abstract = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

abstract = {For species in which group membership frequently changes, it has been a challenge to characterize variation in individual interactions and social structure. Quantifying this variation is necessary to test hypotheses about ecological determinants of social patterns and to make predictions about how group dynamics affect the development of cooperative relationships and transmission processes. Network models have recently become popular for analyzing individual contacts within a population context. We use network metrics to compare populations of Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) and onagers (Equus hemionus khur). These closely related equids, previously described as having the same social system, inhabit environments differing in the distribution of food, water, and predators. Grevy's zebra and onagers are one example of many sets of coarsely similar fission-fusion species and populations, observed elsewhere in other ungulates, primates, and cetaceans. Our analysis of the population association networks reveals contrasts consistent with their distinctive environments. Grevy's zebra individuals are more selective in their association choices. Grevy's zebra form stable cliques, while onager associations are more fluid. We find evidence that females associate assortatively by reproductive state in Grevy's zebra but not in onagers. The current approach demonstrates the utility of network metrics for identifying fine-grained variation among individuals and populations in association patterns. From our analysis, we can make testable predictions about behavioral mechanisms underlying social structure and its effects on transmission processes.},

In this paper, we propose a new variant of the community detection problem, called friendly community search. In the proposed problem, for a given graph, we aim to not only find a densely connected subgraph that contains a given set of query nodes but also minimizes the number of nodes involved in bad relationships in the subgraph. We prove that is Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard), and develop two novel algorithms, called GREEDY and STEINERSWAP that return the near optimal solutions. Experimental results show that two proposed algorithms outperform the algorithm adapted from an existing algorithm for the optimal quasi-clique problem.},

In this paper, an algorithm which considers the historic community structure of networks is developed to detect evolutionary community structure in dynamic weighted networks. In the proposed algorithm, two measures are proposed to determine whether to add a node to a community and whether to merge two communities to form a new community. The proposed algorithm can automatically discover evolutionary community structure in weighted networks whose number of nodes and communities are changing over time and does not need to determine the number of communities in advance. The algorithm is tested using a synthetic network and two real-word complex networks. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can discover evolutionary community structure in dynamic weighted networks effectively.},

abstract = {The Internet is composed of routing devices connected between them and organized into independent administrative entities: the Autonomous Systems. The existence of different types of Autonomous Systems (like large connectivity providers, Internet Service Providers or universities) together with geographical and economical constraints, turns the Internet into a complex modular and hierarchical network. This organization is reflected in many properties of the Internet topology, like its high degree of clustering and its robustness.   In this work, we study the modular structure of the Internet router-level graph in order to assess to what extent the Autonomous Systems satisfy some of the known notions of community structure. We show that the modular structure of the Internet is much richer than what can be captured by the current community detection methods, which are severely affected by resolution limits and by the heterogeneity of the Autonomous Systems. Here we overcome this issue by using a multiresolution detection algorithm combined with a small sample of nodes. We also discuss recent work on community structure in the light of our results.},

abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

abstract = {Unveiling the community structure of networks is a powerful methodology to comprehend interconnected systems across the social and natural sciences. To identify different types of functional modules in interaction data aggregated in a single network layer, researchers have developed many powerful methods. For example, flow-based methods have proven useful for identifying modular dynamics in weighted and directed networks that capture constraints on flow in the systems they represent. However, many networked systems consist of agents or components that exhibit multiple layers of interactions. Inevitably, representing this intricate network of networks as a single aggregated network leads to information loss and may obscure the actual organization. Here we propose a method based on compression of network flows that can identify modular flows in non-aggregated multilayer networks. Our numerical experiments on synthetic networks show that the method can accurately identify modules that cannot be identified in aggregated networks or by analyzing the layers separately. We capitalize on our findings and reveal the community structure of two multilayer collaboration networks: scientists affiliated to the Pierre Auger Observatory and scientists publishing works on networks on the arXiv. Compared to conventional aggregated methods, the multilayer method reveals smaller modules with more overlap that better capture the actual organization.},

abstract = {Brain function depends on efficient processing and integration of information within a complex network of neural interactions, known as the connectome. An important aspect of connectome architecture is the existence of community structure, providing an anatomical basis for the occurrence of functional specialization. Typically, communities are defined as groups of densely connected network nodes, representing clusters of brain regions. Looking at the connectome from a different perspective, instead focusing on the interconnecting links or edges, we find that the white matter pathways between brain regions also exhibit community structure. Eleven link communities were identified: five spanning through the midline fissure, three through the left hemisphere and three through the right hemisphere. We show that these link communities are consistently identifiable and investigate the network characteristics of their underlying white matter pathways. Furthermore, examination of the relationship between link communities and brain regions revealed that the majority of brain regions participate in multiple link communities. In particular, the highly connected and central hub regions showed a rich level of community participation, supporting the notion that these hubs play a pivotal role as confluence zones in which neural information from different domains merges.},

Many deterministic and probabilistic clustering methods have been developed to analyze such structures. Given a network, almost all of them partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, according to their connection profile. However, recent studies have shown that these techniques were too restrictive and that most of the existing networks contained overlapping clusters. To tackle this issue, we present in this paper the Overlapping Stochastic Block Model. Our approach allows the vertices to belong to multiple clusters, and, to some extent, generalizes the well-known Stochastic Block Model [Nowicki and Snijders (2001)]. We show that the model is generically identifiable within classes of equivalence and we propose an approximate inference procedure, based on global and local variational techniques. Using toy data sets as well as the French Political Blogosphere network and the transcriptional network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we compare our work with other approaches.},

abstract = {Decreasing the number of people who must be vaccinated to immunize a community against an infectious disease could both save resources and decrease outbreak sizes. A key to reaching such a lower threshold of immunization is to find and vaccinate people who, through their behavior, are more likely than average to become infected and to spread the disease further. Fortunately, the very behavior that makes these people important to vaccinate can help us to localize them. Earlier studies have shown that one can use previous contacts to find people that are central in static contact networks. However, real contact patterns are not static. In this paper, we investigate if there is additional information in the temporal contact structure for vaccination protocols to exploit. We answer this affirmative by proposing two immunization methods that exploit temporal correlations and showing that these methods outperform a benchmark static-network protocol in four empirical contact datasets under various epidemic scenarios. Both methods rely only on obtainable, local information, and can be implemented in practice. For the datasets directly related to contact patterns of potential disease spreading (of sexually-transmitted and nosocomial infections respectively), the most efficient protocol is to sample people at random and vaccinate their latest contacts. The network datasets are temporal, which enables us to make more realistic evaluations than earlier studies--we use only information about the past for the purpose of vaccination, and about the future to simulate disease outbreaks. Using analytically tractable models, we identify two temporal structures that explain how the protocols earn their efficiency in the empirical data. This paper is a first step towards real vaccination protocols that exploit temporal-network structure--future work is needed both to characterize the structure of real contact sequences and to devise immunization methods that exploit these.},

abstract = {Link Clustering (LC) is a relatively new method for detecting overlapping communities in networks. The basic principle of LC is to derive a transform matrix whose elements are composed of the link similarity of neighbor links based on the Jaccard distance calculation; then it applies hierarchical clustering to the transform matrix and uses a measure of partition density on the resulting dendrogram to determine the cut level for best community detection. However, the original link clustering method does not consider the link similarity of non-neighbor links, and the partition density tends to divide the communities into many small communities. In this paper, an Extended Link Clustering method (ELC) for overlapping community detection is proposed. The improved method employs a new link similarity, Extended Link Similarity (ELS), to produce a denser transform matrix, and uses the maximum value of EQ (an extended measure of quality of modularity) as a means to optimally cut the dendrogram for better partitioning of the original network space. Since ELS uses more link information, the resulting transform matrix provides a superior basis for clustering and analysis. Further, using the EQ value to find the best level for the hierarchical clustering dendrogram division, we obtain communities that are more sensible and reasonable than the ones obtained by the partition density evaluation. Experimentation on five real-world networks and artificially-generated networks shows that the ELC method achieves higher EQ and In-group Proportion (IGP) values. Additionally, communities are more realistic than those generated by either of the original LC method or the classical CPM method.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of temporal network data is calling for more research on extracting and characterizing mesoscopic structures in temporal networks and on relating such structure to specific functions or properties of the system. An outstanding challenge is the extension of the results achieved for static networks to time-varying networks, where the topological structure of the system and the temporal activity patterns of its components are intertwined. Here we investigate the use of a latent factor decomposition technique, non-negative tensor factorization, to extract the community-activity structure of temporal networks. The method is intrinsically temporal and allows to simultaneously identify communities and to track their activity over time. We represent the time-varying adjacency matrix of a temporal network as a three-way tensor and approximate this tensor as a sum of terms that can be interpreted as communities of nodes with an associated activity time series. We summarize known computational techniques for tensor decomposition and discuss some quality metrics that can be used to tune the complexity of the factorized representation. We subsequently apply tensor factorization to a temporal network for which a ground truth is available for both the community structure and the temporal activity patterns. The data we use describe the social interactions of students in a school, the associations between students and school classes, and the spatio-temporal trajectories of students over time. We show that non-negative tensor factorization is capable of recovering the class structure with high accuracy. In particular, the extracted tensor components can be validated either as known school classes, or in terms of correlated activity patterns, i.e., of spatial and temporal coincidences that are determined by the known school activity schedule.},

However, it updates the labels of nodes asynchronously in random order to avoid label oscillations, resulting in poor performance, weak robustness and difficulty in parallelizing the update procedure for large-scale network and distributed dynamic complex networks. We propose a novel strategy named LPA-S to update the labels of nodes synchronously by the probability of each surrounding label, which is easy to be parallelized. We experimentally investigate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy by comparing with asynchronous LPA on both computer-generated networks and real-world networks. The experimental results show our LPA-S does not harm the quality of the partitioning while can be easily parallelized.},

In this paper, we propose a dynamic stochastic block model for finding communities and their evolution in a dynamic social network. The proposed model captures the evolution of communities by explicitly modeling the transition of community memberships for individual nodes in the network. Unlike many existing approaches for modeling social networks that estimate parameters by their most likely values (i.e., point estimation), in this study, we employ a Bayesian treatment for parameter estimation that computes the posterior distributions for all the unknown parameters. This Bayesian treatment allows us to capture the uncertainty in parameter values and therefore is more robust to data noise than point estimation. In addition, an efficient algorithm is developed for Bayesian inference to handle large sparse social networks. Extensive experimental studies based on both synthetic data and real-life data demonstrate that our model achieves higher accuracy and reveals more insights in the data than several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {This study of collective behavior is to understand how individuals behave in a social networking environment. Oceans of data generated by social media like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube present opportunities and challenges to study collective behavior on a large scale. In this work, we aim to learn to predict collective behavior in social media. In particular, given information about some individuals, how can we infer the behavior of unobserved individuals in the same network? A social-dimension-based approach has been shown effective in addressing the heterogeneity of connections presented in social media. However, the networks in social media are normally of colossal size, involving hundreds of thousands of actors. The scale of these networks entails scalable learning of models for collective behavior prediction. To address the scalability issue, we propose an edge-centric clustering scheme to extract sparse social dimensions. With sparse social dimensions, the proposed approach can efficiently handle networks of millions of actors while demonstrating a comparable prediction performance to other nonscalable methods.},

abstract = {The pattern of interactions between individuals in a population contains implicitly within them a remarkable amount of information. This information, if extracted, could be of significant importance in several realms such as containing the spread of disease, understanding information flow in social systems and predicting likely future interactions. A popular method of discovering structure in networks is through community detection which attempts to capture the extent to which that network is different from a random network. However, communities are not very well defined for time-varying networks. In this paper, we introduce the notion of spatio-temporal communities that attempts to capture the structure in spatial connections as well as temporal changes in a network. We illustrate the notion via several examples and list the challenges in effectively discovering spatio-temporal communities. For example, such communities are lost if the temporal interactions are aggregated in a single weighted network since the concurrency information is lost. We present an approach that first extracts concurrency information via node-clustering on each snapshot. Each node is then assigned a vector of community memberships over time, which is then used to group nodes into overlapping communities via recently introduced link clustering techniques. However we measure similarity (of nodes and edges) based on concurrence, i.e. when they existed, if they existed together. We call our approach the co-community algorithm. We validate our approach using several real-world data sets spanning multiple contexts.},

Our method is based on the following framework: find the overlapping temporal community structure that maximizes a quality function associated with each snapshot of the network subject to a temporal smoothness constraint. A novel quality function and a smoothness constraint are proposed to handle overlaps, and a new convex relaxation is used to solve the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. We provide theoretical guarantees as well as experimental results that reveal community structure in real and synthetic networks. Our main insight is that certain structures can be identified only when temporal correlation is considered and when communities are allowed to overlap. In general, discovering such overlapping temporal community structure can enhance our understanding of real-world complex networks by revealing the underlying stability behind their seemingly chaotic evolution.},

abstract = {Network modeling plays a critical role in identifying statistical regularities and structural principles common to many systems. The large majority of recent modeling approaches are connectivity driven. The structural patterns of the network are at the basis of the mechanisms ruling the network formation. Connectivity driven models necessarily provide a time-aggregated representation that may fail to describe the instantaneous and fluctuating dynamics of many networks. We address this challenge by defining the activity potential, a time invariant function characterizing the agents' interactions and constructing an activity driven model capable of encoding the instantaneous time description of the network dynamics. The model provides an explanation of structural features such as the presence of hubs, which simply originate from the heterogeneous activity of agents. Within this framework, highly dynamical networks can be described analytically, allowing a quantitative discussion of the biases induced by the time-aggregated representations in the analysis of dynamical processes.},

abstract = {Given their importance in shaping social networks and determining how information or diseases propagate in a population, human interactions are the subject of many data collection efforts. To this aim, different methods are commonly used, from diaries and surveys to wearable sensors. These methods show advantages and limitations but are rarely compared in a given setting. As surveys targeting friendship relations might suffer less from memory biases than contact diaries, it is also interesting to explore how daily contact patterns compare with friendship relations and with online social links. Here we make progresses in these directions by leveraging data from a French high school: face-to-face contacts measured by two concurrent methods, sensors and diaries; self-reported friendship surveys; Facebook links. We compare the data sets and find that most short contacts are not reported in diaries while long contacts have larger reporting probability, with a general tendency to overestimate durations. Measured contacts corresponding to reported friendship can have durations of any length but all long contacts correspond to reported friendships. Online links not associated to reported friendships correspond to short face-to-face contacts, highlighting the different nature of reported friendships and online links. Diaries and surveys suffer from a low sampling rate, showing the higher acceptability of sensor-based platform. Despite the biases, we found that the overall structure of the contact network, i.e., the mixing patterns between classes, is correctly captured by both self-reported contacts and friendships networks. Overall, diaries and surveys tend to yield a correct picture of the structural organization of the contact network, albeit with much less links, and give access to a sort of backbone of the contact network corresponding to the strongest links in terms of cumulative durations.},

abstract = {K-means is a simple and efficient clustering algorithm to detect communities in networks. However, it may suffer from a bad choice of initial seeds (also called centers) that seriously affect the clustering accuracy and the convergence rate. Additionally, in K-means, the number of communities should be specified in advance. Till now, it is still an open problem on how to select initial seeds and how to determine the number of communities. In this study, a new parameter-free community detection method (named K-rank-D) was proposed. First, based on the fact that good initial seeds usually have high importance and are dispersedly located in a network, we proposed a modified PageRank centrality to evaluate the importance of a node, and drew a decision graph to depict the importance and the dispersion of nodes. Then, the initial seeds and the number of communities were selected from the decision graph actively and intuitively as the ‘start' parameter of K-means. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over competing methods for community detection.},

abstract = {Recent research on temporal networks has highlighted the limitations of a static network perspective for our understanding of complex systems with dynamic topologies. In particular, recent works have shown that i) the specific order in which links occur in real-world temporal networks affects causality structures and thus the evolution of dynamical processes, and ii) higher-order aggregate representations of temporal networks can be used to analytically study the effect of these order correlations on dynamical processes. In this article we analyze the effect of order correlations on path-based centrality measures in real-world temporal networks. Analyzing temporal equivalents of betweenness, closeness and reach centrality in six empirical temporal networks, we first show that an analysis of the commonly used static, time-aggregated representation can give misleading results about the actual importance of nodes. We further study higher-order time-aggregated networks, a recently proposed generalization of the commonly applied static, time-aggregated representation of temporal networks. Here, we particularly define path-based centrality measures based on second-order aggregate networks, empirically validating that node centralities calculated in this way better capture the true temporal centralities of nodes than node centralities calculated based on the commonly used static (first-order) representation. Apart from providing a simple and practical method for the approximation of path-based centralities in temporal networks, our results highlight interesting perspectives for the use of higher-order aggregate networks in the analysis of time-stamped network data.},

However, the overlapping concept has received little attentions in the literature, although it is observed in almost all social networks. In this study, we propose a framework based on the game theory and the structural equivalence concept to address the detection of overlapping communities in social networks. Specifically, we consider the underlying graph as a hypothetical social networking website and regard each vertex of this graph as an agent performing in this multiagent environment. Since each agent may belong to several communities simultaneously, we are able to find overlapping community structure of social networks. The rigorous proof of the existence of Nash equilibrium in this game is provided which shows that the method always reaches to the final solution. Experimental results on the benchmark and real world graphs show superiority of our approach over the other state-of-the-art methods.},

We also introduce a criterion to select the best window sizes, which most concisely capture the key oscillatory as well as aperiodic trends. Our key insight lies in learning an optimal orthonormal transform from the data itself, as opposed to using a predetermined basis or approximating function (such as piecewise constant, short-window Fourier or wavelets), which essentially restricts us to a particular family of trends. We go one step further, lifting even that limitation. Furthermore, our method lends itself to fast, incremental estimation in a streaming setting. Experimental evaluation shows that our method can capture meaningful patterns in a variety of settings. Our streaming approach requires order of magnitude less time and space, while still producing concise and informative patterns.},

abstract = {The quest for a quantitative characterization of community and modular structure of complex networks produced a variety of methods and algorithms to classify different networks. However, it is not clear if such methods provide consistent, robust and meaningful results when considering hierarchies as a whole. Part of the problem is the lack of a similarity measure for the comparison of hierarchical community structures. In this work we give a contribution by introducing the {\{}$\backslash$it hierarchical mutual information{\}}, which is a generalization of the traditional mutual information, and allows to compare hierarchical partitions and hierarchical community structures. The {\{}$\backslash$it normalized{\}} version of the hierarchical mutual information should behave analogously to the traditional normalized mutual information. Here, the correct behavior of the hierarchical mutual information is corroborated on an extensive battery of numerical experiments. The experiments are performed on artificial hierarchies, and on the hierarchical community structure of artificial and empirical networks. Furthermore, the experiments illustrate some of the practical applications of the hierarchical mutual information. Namely, the comparison of different community detection methods, and the study of the the consistency, robustness and temporal evolution of the hierarchical modular structure of networks.},

abstract = {Networks are a convenient way to represent complex systems of interacting entities. Many networks contain "communities" of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to nodes in the rest of the network. In this paper, we investigate the detection of communities in temporal networks represented as multilayer networks. As a focal example, we study time-dependent financial-asset correlation networks. We first argue that the use of the "modularity" quality function---which is defined by comparing edge weights in an observed network to expected edge weights in a "null network"---is application-dependent. We differentiate between "null networks" and "null models" in our discussion of modularity maximization, and we highlight that the same null network can correspond to different null models. We then investigate a multilayer modularity-maximization problem to identify communities in temporal networks. Our multilayer analysis only depends on the form of the maximization problem and not on the specific quality function that one chooses. We introduce a diagnostic to measure $\backslash$emph{\{}persistence{\}} of community structure in a multilayer network partition. We prove several results that describe how the multilayer maximization problem measures a trade-off between static community structure within layers and higher values of persistence across layers. We also discuss some implementation issues that the popular "Louvain" heuristic faces with temporal multilayer networks and suggest ways to mitigate them.},

@article{Krings2012,
abstract = {Complex networks are often constructed by aggregating empirical data over time, such that a link represents the existence of interactions between the endpoint nodes and the link weight represents the intensity of such interactions within the aggregation time window. The resulting networks are then often considered static. More often than not, the aggregation time window is dictated by the availability of data, and the effects of its length on the resulting networks are rarely considered. Here, we address this question by studying the structural features of networks emerging from aggregating empirical data over different time intervals, focussing on networks derived from time-stamped, anonymized mobile telephone call records. Our results show that short aggregation intervals yield networks where strong links associated with dense clusters dominate; the seeds of such clusters or communities become already visible for intervals of around one week. The degree and weight distributions are seen to become stationary around a few days and a few weeks, respectively. An aggregation interval of around 30 days results in the stablest similar networks when consecutive windows are compared. For longer intervals, the effects of weak or random links become increasingly stronger, and the average degree of the network keeps growing even for intervals up to 180 days. The placement of the time window is also seen to affect the outcome: for short windows, different behavioural patterns play a role during weekends and weekdays, and for longer windows it is seen that networks aggregated during holiday periods are significantly different.},

@article{Delvenne2010,
abstract = {The complexity of biological, social, and engineering networks makes it desirable to find natural partitions into clusters (or communities) that can provide insight into the structure of the overall system and even act as simplified functional descriptions. Although methods for community detection abound, there is a lack of consensus on how to quantify and rank the quality of partitions. We introduce here the stability of a partition, a measure of its quality as a community structure based on the clustered autocovariance of a dynamic Markov process taking place on the network. Because the stability has an intrinsic dependence on time scales of the graph, it allows us to compare and rank partitions at each time and also to establish the time spans over which partitions are optimal. Hence the Markov time acts effectively as an intrinsic resolution parameter that establishes a hierarchy of increasingly coarser communities. Our dynamical definition provides a unifying framework for several standard partitioning measures: modularity and normalized cut size can be interpreted as one-step time measures, whereas Fiedler's spectral clustering emerges at long times. We apply our method to characterize the relevance of partitions over time for constructive and real networks, including hierarchical graphs and social networks, and use it to obtain reduced descriptions for atomic-level protein structures over different time scales.},

abstract = {Research topics and research communities are not disconnected from each other: communities and topics are interwoven and co-evolving. Yet, scientometric evaluations of topics and communities have been conducted independently and synchronically, with researchers often relying on homogeneous unit of analysis, such as authors, journals, institutions, or topics. Therefore, new methods are warranted that examine the dynamic relationship between topics and communities. This paper examines how research topics are mixed and matched in evolving research communities by using a hybrid approach which integrates both topic identification and community detection techniques. Using a data set on information retrieval (IR) publications, two layers of enriched information are constructed and contrasted: one is the communities detected through the topology of coauthorship network and the other is the topics of the communities detected through the topic model. We find evidence to support the assumption that IR communities and topics are interwoven and co-evolving, and topics can be used to understand the dynamics of community structures. We recommend the use of the hybrid approach to study the dynamic interactions of topics and communities. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A discrete-time network model is proposed firstly in this paper, and then the phase clustering dynamics of the networks are studied carefully. The proposed model acts as a bridge between the dynamic phenomenon and the topology of a modular network. On one hand, phase clustering phenomenon will occur for a modular network by the proposed model; on the other hand, the communities can be identified from the clustering phenomenon. Beyond the phases{\&}apos; information, it is found that the frequencies of phases can be applied to community detection also with the proposed model. In specific, communities are identified from the information of phases and their frequencies of the nodes. Detailed algorithm for community detection is provided. Experiments show that the performance and efficiency of the dynamics based algorithm are competitive with recent modularity based algorithms in large scale networks.},

abstract = {From June 2014 to January 2015, the slumped price of crude oil mainly be caused by the increasing shale gas in the U.S. The market of crude oil was altered by the variation of natural gas trade patterns. It implies that the international fossil energy trade is a multilayer structure, and each layer is a complex system with numerous countries and complicated relations. In this paper, we build the international fossil energy trade multilayer network (ETMN), and study the evolutionary characteristics of networks during 2002–2013. The generalization of several important indicators, including degree distribution, community, stability of communities and the time-varying evolution of main countries' importance were discussed. Our conclusions suggest that: Firstly, the ETMN and three energy-specific networks including coal, oil, and natural gas display the scale-free characteristic in un-weighted and weighted networks. However, it shows that even if a few countries have major trading partners, there are not always a few countries that play critical roles in trade intensity. Secondly, the natural gas network has the largest number of communities and stability compared with networks of coal and oil, and the volatility of stability lagged one year than the other two networks for the specific form of pipeline transportation. Thirdly, studying on the stability of networks shows that geopolitical environment is the most important influenced factor, but the status of renewable and new energy increases with its development obviously. Fourthly, the evolutionary characteristics of three major countries' importance, including United States, China and Japan, are analyzed in detail. At last, some policy suggestions were pointed out according to the results.},

Our approach is based on a Bayesian model of networks that allows nodes to participate in multiple communities, and a corresponding algorithm that naturally interleaves subsampling from the network and updating an estimate of its communities. We demonstrate how we can discover the hidden community structure of several real-world networks, including 3.7 million US patents, 575,000 physics articles from the arXiv preprint server, and 875,000 connected Web pages from the Internet.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study focused on the descriptive analysis of cattle movements and farm-level parameters derived from cattle movements, which are considered to be generically suitable for risk-based surveillance systems in Switzerland for diseases where animal movements constitute an important risk pathway.

METHODS: A framework was developed to select farms for surveillance based on a risk score summarizing 5 parameters. The proposed framework was validated using data from the bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) surveillance programme in 2013.

RESULTS: A cumulative score was calculated per farm, including the following parameters; the maximum monthly ingoing contact chain (in 2012), the average number of animals per incoming movement, use of mixed alpine pastures and the number of weeks in 2012 a farm had movements registered. The final score for the farm depended on the distribution of the parameters. Different cut offs; 50, 90, 95 and 99 {\%}, were explored. The final scores ranged between 0 and 5. Validation of the scores against results from the BVD surveillance programme 2013 gave promising results for setting the cut off for each of the five selected farm level criteria at the 50th percentile. Restricting testing to farms with a score ≥ 2 would have resulted in the same number of detected BVD positive farms as testing all farms, i.e., the outcome of the 2013 surveillance programme could have been reached with a smaller survey.

CONCLUSIONS: The seasonality and time dependency of the activity of single farms in the networks requires a careful assessment of the actual time period included to determine farm level criteria. However, selecting farms in the sample for risk-based surveillance can be optimized with the proposed scoring system. The system was validated using data from the BVD eradication program. The proposed method is a promising framework for the selection of farms according to the risk of infection based on animal movements.},

abstract = {Time series clustering is a research topic of practical importance in temporal data mining. The goal is to identify groups of similar time series in a data base. In this paper, we propose a technique for time series clustering via community detection in complex networks. First, we construct a network where every vertex represents a time series connected its most similar ones,. Similarity was calculated using different time series distance functions. Then, we applied a community detection algorithm to identify groups of strongly connected vertices in order to produce time series clusters. We verified which distance function works better with every clustering algorithm and compared them to our approach. The experimental results show that our approach statistically outperformed many traditional clustering algorithms. We find that the community detection approach can detect groups that other techniques fail to identify.},

abstract = {Complex networks topologies present interesting and surprising properties, such as community structures, which can be exploited to optimize communication, to find new efficient and context-aware routing algorithms or simply to understand the dynamics and meaning of relationships among nodes. Complex networks are gaining more and more importance as a reference model and are a powerful interpretation tool for many different kinds of natural, biological and social networks, where directed relationships and contextual belonging of nodes to many different communities is a matter of fact. This paper starts from the definition of modularity function, given by M. Newman to evaluate the goodness of network community decompositions, and extends it to the more general case of directed graphs with overlapping community structures. Interesting properties of the proposed extension are discussed, a method for finding overlapping communities is proposed and results of its application to benchmark case-studies are reported. We also propose a new dataset which could be used as a reference benchmark for overlapping community structures identification.},

abstract = {Big data has become an important issue for a large number of research areas such as data mining, machine learning, computational intelligence, information fusion, the semantic Web, and social networks. The rise of different big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and, more recently, Spark, for massive data processing based on the MapReduce paradigm has allowed for the efficient utilisation of data mining methods and machine learning algorithms in different domains. A number of libraries such as Mahout and SparkMLib have been designed to develop new efficient applications based on machine learning algorithms. The combination of big data technologies and traditional machine learning algorithms has generated new and interesting challenges in other areas as social media and social networks. These new challenges are focused mainly on problems such as data processing, data storage, data representation, and how data can be used for pattern mining, analysing user behaviours, and visualizing and tracking data, among others. In this paper, we present a revision of the new methodologies that is designed to allow for efficient data mining and information fusion from social media and of the new applications and frameworks that are currently appearing under the “umbrella” of the social networks, social media and big data paradigms.},

abstract = {One of network epidemiology's central assumptions is that the contact structure over which infectious diseases propagate can be represented as a static network. However, contacts are highly dynamic, changing at many time scales. In this paper, we investigate conceptually simple methods to construct static graphs for network epidemiology from temporal contact data. We evaluate these methods on empirical and synthetic model data. For almost all our cases, the network representation that captures most relevant information is a so-called exponential-threshold network. In these, each contact contributes with a weight decreasing exponentially with time, and there is an edge between a pair of vertices if the weight between them exceeds a threshold. Networks of aggregated contacts over an optimally chosen time window perform almost as good as the exponential-threshold networks. On the other hand, networks of accumulated contacts over the entire sampling time, and networks of concurrent partnerships, perform worse. We discuss these observations in the context of the temporal and topological structure of the data sets.},

abstract = {Network dynamics plays an important role in analyzing the correlation between the function properties and the topological structure. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamical iteration (DI) algorithm, which incorporates the iterative process of membership vector with weighting scheme, i.e. weighting W and tightness T. These new elements can be used to adjust the link strength and the node compactness for improving the speed and accuracy of community structure detection. To estimate the optimal stop time of iteration, we utilize a new stability measure which is defined as the Markov random walk auto-covariance. We do not need to specify the number of communities in advance. It naturally supports the overlapping communities by associating each node with a membership vector describing the node's involvement in each community. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that the algorithm can uncover communities effectively and efficiently.},

In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting communities in such networks. Our method is based on optimizing the composite modularity, which is a new modularity proposed for evaluating partitions of a heterogeneous multi-relational network into communities. Our method is parameter-free, scalable, and suitable for various networks with general structure. We demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in detecting pre-planted communities in synthetic networks. Applied to a real-world Digg network, it successfully detects meaningful communities.},

abstract = {Face-to-face contacts between individuals contribute to shape social networks and play an important role in determining how infectious diseases can spread within a population. It is thus important to obtain accurate and reliable descriptions of human contact patterns occurring in various day-to-day life contexts. Recent technological advances and the development of wearable sensors able to sense proximity patterns have made it possible to gather data giving access to time-varying contact networks of individuals in specific environments. Here we present and analyze two such data sets describing with high temporal resolution the contact patterns of students in a high school. We define contact matrices describing the contact patterns between students of different classes and show the importance of the class structure. We take advantage of the fact that the two data sets were collected in the same setting during several days in two successive years to perform a longitudinal analysis on two very different timescales. We show the high stability of the contact patterns across days and across years: the statistical distributions of numbers and durations of contacts are the same in different periods, and we observe a very high similarity of the contact matrices measured in different days or different years. The rate of change of the contacts of each individual from one day to the next is also similar in different years. We discuss the interest of the present analysis and data sets for various fields, including in social sciences in order to better understand and model human behavior and interactions in different contexts, and in epidemiology in order to inform models describing the spread of infectious diseases and design targeted containment strategies.},

abstract = {Electronic communication records provide detailed information about temporal aspects of human interaction. Previous studies have shown that individuals' communication patterns have complex temporal structure, and that this structure has system-wide effects. In this paper we use mobile phone records to show that interaction patterns involving multiple individuals have non-trivial temporal structure that cannot be deduced from a network presentation where only interaction frequencies are taken into account. We apply a recently introduced method, temporal motifs, to identify interaction patterns in a temporal network where nodes have additional attributes such as gender and age. We then develop a null model that allows identifying differences between various types of nodes so that these differences are independent of the network based on interaction frequencies. We find gender-related differences in communication patters, and show the existence of temporal homophily, the tendency of similar individuals to participate in interaction patterns beyond what would be expected on the basis of the network structure alone. We also show that temporal patterns differ between dense and sparse parts of the network. Because this result is independent of edge weights, it can be considered as an extension of Granovetter's hypothesis to temporal networks.},

abstract = {Many complex systems, including networks, are not static but can display strong fluctuations at various time scales. Characterizing the dynamics in complex networks is thus of the utmost importance in the understanding of these networks and of the dynamical processes taking place on them. In this article, we study the example of the US airport network in the time period 1990-2000. We show that even if the statistical distributions of most indicators are stationary, an intense activity takes place at the local ("microscopic") level, with many disappearing/appearing connections (links) between airports. We find that connections have a very broad distribution of lifetimes, and we introduce a set of metrics to characterize the links' dynamics. We observe in particular that the links that disappear have essentially the same properties as the ones that appear, and that links that connect airports with very different traffic are very volatile. Motivated by this empirical study, we propose a model of dynamical networks, inspired from previous studies on firm growth, which reproduces most of the empirical observations both for the stationary statistical distributions and for the dynamical properties.},

Here, we study the daily communication patterns of 24 individuals over 18 months, and show that each individual has a different, persistent communication pattern. These patterns may differ for calls and text messages, which points towards calls and texts serving a different role in communication. For both calls and texts, evenings play a special role. There are also differences in the daily patterns of males and females both for calls and texts, both in how they communicate with individuals of the same gender vs. opposite gender, and also in how communication is allocated at social ties of different nature (kin ties vs. non-kin ties). Taken together, our results show that there is an unexpected richness to the daily communication patterns, from different types of ties being activated at different times of day to different roles of communication channels and gender differences.},

For the many applications where cluster change is relevant, among them customer relation- ship management, fraud detection and marketing, it is also necessary to provide insights about the nature of cluster change: Is a cluster corresponding to a group of customers simply disappearing or are its members migrating to other clusters? Is a new emerging cluster reflecting a new target group of customers or does it rather consist of existing cus- tomers whose preferences shift? To answer such questions, we propose the framework MONIC for modeling and tracking of cluster transitions. Our cluster transition model en- compasses changes that involve more than one cluster, thus allowing for insights on cluster change in the whole clus- tering. Our transition tracking mechanism is not based on the topological properties of clusters, which are only available for some types of clustering, but on the contents of the underlying data stream. We present our first results on monitoring cluster transitions over the ACMdigital library.},

Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science: studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline.},

abstract = {Community detection in the social networks is one of the most important tasks of social computing. Highly relevant researches indicate that the social network generally contains both an overlapping and hierarchical structure. This paper introduces an efficient and functional community detection algorithm MOHCC, which can concurrently discover overlapping and hierarchical organization in complex networks. This algorithm first extracts all maximal cliques from the original complex network. Merges all extracted maximal cliques into a dendrogram by using the aggregative framework presented in MOHCC. Finally, it cuts through the dendrogram and obtains a network partition with maximum extended partition density. Experimental results utilizing computer-generated artificial networks and real-world social benchmark networks give satisfactory correspondence.},

abstract = {This paper describes Cluster Sculptor, a novel interactive clustering system that allows a user to iteratively update the cluster labels of a data set, and an associated low-dimensional projection. The system is fed by clustering results computed in a high-dimensional space, and uses a two-dimensional (2D) projection, both as support for overlaying the cluster labels, and engaging user interaction. By easily interacting with elements directly in the visualization, the user can inject his or her domain knowledge progressively. Via interactive controls, the distribution of the data in the 2D space can be used to amend the cluster labels. Reciprocally, the 2D projection can be updated so as to emphasize the current clusters. The 2D projection updates follow a smooth physical metaphor that gives insight of the process to the user. Updates can be interrupted any time, for further data inspection, or modifying the input preferences. The interest of the system is demonstrated by detailed experimental scenarios on three real data sets.},

abstract = {Smartcard data provide a great number of information that are increasingly used nowadays. In the field of transport, they offer the opportunity to study passenger behavior, leading to a better knowledge of public transit demand and thereby granting the transport operators the ability to adapt their transport offer and services accordingly, both in space and in time. In particular, an accurate characterization of mobility patterns using data mining approches has a very strong interest for transport planning purposes. This paper aims to propose a two-level generative mixture model that partitions passengers according to their temporal profiles. Using the timestamps of the passengers' transactions in the public transport network, the first level models the passengers partitioning into a reduced set of clusters, whereas the second level captures how the trips made by each cluster of passengers are distributed over time. The proposed approach is applied on real ticketing data collected from the urban transport network of Rennes M??tropole (France). The obtained results show that different passenger profiles can be discovered, thus highlighting several patterns of transport demand. The crossing of the clustering results with smartcard fare types as well as city characteristics such as academic centralities is also conducted in order to identify the close link between urban mobility and the socio-economic characteristics of the city.},

@article{Murase2015,
abstract = {In social networks of human individuals, social relationships do not necessarily last forever as they can either fade gradually with time, resulting in link aging, or terminate abruptly, causing link deletion, as even old friendships may cease. In this paper, we study a social network formation model where we introduce several ways by which a link termination takes place. If we adopt the link aging, we get a more modular structure with more homogeneously distributed link weights within communities than when link deletion is used. By investigating distributions and relations of various network characteristics, we find that the empirical findings are better reproduced with the link deletion model. This indicates that link deletion plays a more prominent role in organizing social networks than link aging.},

abstract = {Recent studies on electronic communication records have shown that human communication has complex temporal structure. We study how communication patterns that involve multiple individuals are affected by attributes such as sex and age. To this end, we represent the communication records as a colored temporal network where node color is used to represent individuals' attributes, and identify patterns known as temporal motifs. We then construct a null model for the occurrence of temporal motifs that takes into account the interaction frequencies and connectivity between nodes of different colors. This null model allows us to detect significant patterns in call sequences that cannot be observed in a static network that uses interaction frequencies as link weights. We find sex-related differences in communication patterns in a large dataset of mobile phone records and show the existence of temporal homophily, the tendency of similar individuals to participate in communication patterns beyond what would be expected on the basis of their average interaction frequencies. We also show that temporal patterns differ between dense and sparse neighborhoods in the network. Because also this result is independent of interaction frequencies, it can be seen as an extension of Granovetter's hypothesis to temporal networks.},

abstract = {Significant efforts have gone into the development of statistical models for analyzing data in the form of networks, such as social networks. Most existing work has focused on modeling static networks, which represent either a single time snapshot or an aggregate view over time. There has been recent interest in statistical modeling of dynamic networks, which are observed at multiple points in time and offer a richer representation of many complex phenomena. In this paper, we propose a state-space model for dynamic networks that extends the well-known stochastic blockmodel for static networks to the dynamic setting. We then propose a procedure to fit the model using a modification of the extended Kalman filter augmented with a local search. We apply the procedure to analyze a dynamic social network of email communication.},

abstract = {It has recently become possible to record detailed social interactions in large social systems with high resolution. As we study these datasets, human social interactions display patterns that emerge at multiple time scales, from minutes to months. On a fundamental level, an understanding of the network dynamics can be used to inform the process of measuring social networks. The details of measurement are of particular importance when considering dynamic processes where minute-to-minute details are important, because collection of physical proximity interactions with high temporal resolution is difficult and expensive. Here, we consider the dynamic network of proximity-interactions between approximately 500 individuals participating in the Copenhagen Networks Study. We show that in order to accurately model spreading processes on the network, the dynamic processes that occur on the order of minutes are essential and must be included in the analysis.},
